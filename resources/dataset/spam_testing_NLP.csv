"DEAR SIR/MADAM I have decided to contact your assistance in relation to the following business proposal, having obtained your contact through the commercial attach of your country's embassy in South Africa. This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president's personal security vault and some of his savings. Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila's national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila's assets and properties with millions of dollars to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father's regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K! . And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri! bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. Thanks and remain blessed. Best Regards, ROMILA KABILA",yes

"Dear Sir, I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of victimization and physical abuse. Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government. Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars. Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us. You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free. You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government. I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com Kind regards, Stanley Woodwork.",yes

"Long time no chat! How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel - the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'. You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was the best decision I've ever made. PERIOD. Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it! I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health. I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus' absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED! If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having any success, and just not getting the results you were promised, then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 'EXTREME POWER PLUS'! You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff actually work?"" Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! Here is the bottom line ... I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my pledge to you. BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

"Major Medical BreakthroughHuge Profit Potential Imagine yourself as part owner of the most interesting, full service state-of-the-art medical facility, equipped with the most sophisticated and effective scanning diagnostic tools available today. Electron Beam Tomography is a cutting-edge diagnostic technology capable of providing a crystal-ball-like look into your medical future. This technology has been featured on Oprah, Larry King, Good Morning America, and USA Today. EBT Scans are now covered by most health insurance companies and HMOs, causing an explosion in usership and exceptionally high demand for this procedure. EBT can identify heart disease years before a treadmill test would show an abnormality and many years before a heart attack might occur. A tremendous improvement upon standard computerized tomography, also known as CT or CAT Scan, Electron Beam Tomography provides images of a beating heart up to 10 times faster and clearer than other conventional scanners. The dramatic capabilities of this spectacular technology should provide an extraordinary investment opportunity for those establishing state-of-the-art outpatient clinics, in order to provide the EBT body scan procedures to health conscious Americans. Projected 10-year return of 916%. A full-body scan using this technology can also be used to detect osteoporosis, aneurisms, emphysema, gallstones, hiatal hernia, degenerative spine conditions, as well as cancer of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and colon.

"Hey there, If you're like me, you've tried EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel - the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped me lose a pound either. It seemed like the harder I tried, the bigger I got, until I heard about a product called Extreme Power Plus. You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but my sister swore it helped her lose 23 pounds in just two weeks, so I told her I'd give it a shot. I mean, there was nothing to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was the best decision I've ever made. Period. Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it! I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer and got permission to resell it - at a BIG discount. I want to help other people lose weight like I did, because it does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health. I give you my personal pledge that Extreme Power Plus absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. If it doesn't, you can return it any time for a full refund. If you are frustrated with trying other products, not having any success, and just not getting the results you were promised, then I recommend the only product that worked for me - EXTREME POWER PLUS. You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff actually work?"" Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS, RESULTS, RESULTS!! Here is the bottom line ... I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. Just try it for one month - there's nothing to lose, and everything to gain. You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. That is my pledge to you.

"fork , From;Mr.David Kargbou and Family, Johannesburg,South Africa. My Dear , Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. My name is Mr.David Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood. During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit. Now this is what I actually want you to do for me; 1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request. Best Regards, Mr.David Kargbou and family.",yes

"Urgent Concern Pls. I am a serious officer with one of our main branches of CITI BANK, consumer Banking Department. Although we didn't have previous correspondence till date. However, based on the standard value place on everything about you, I believed we could discuss, analyze and execute this transaction.The transaction is I've a wealthy client, an American Citizen who had been residing in West Africa for decades now, he operates a fix deposit account with us which I am his account officer, and also receives standing orders for his chains of dividends share. However, this client Mr. David Brown died as an out come of Heart attack,and the funds in his current account has been claimed by his family, who had gone back finally to USA. At the end of Fiscal year, March 2001, an accumulated share of US$12.360M was transferred into his account from the Stock Exchange. This was alone the instructions we issued to the Stock House to dispose all his stocks. Now the funds has arrived, I needed an associate whom I would present as the inheritor of this fund i.e. Associate partner of Mr. David Brown so as to receive this fund. Please note, his family has left since,and never know about this stocks in the exchange and the funds has subsequently matured in his Fix Deposit Account, so I as the account officer has prepared all documents for easy claims of this fund. Immediately, you reach me, I will furnish you with further details and then negotiate on the sharing ratio once you show your sincere involvement to go along with me. It will be of need for you to furnish me also your personal phone and fax numbers for urgent messages. I am anxiously waiting to hear your consent. Be guided.

BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. = Here is another time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials later but first, ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.

Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happen to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5.

Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ======== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ======== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2 . Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example ... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ======= REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ===== Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receivethe report. =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : == REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net"" Order Report #1 A. Christ 1208 Allendale Rd. Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net"" Order Report # 2 Michael P. 2508 Robin Altus, OK 73521 USA _ REPORT # 3: ""Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net"" Order Report # 3 from : D.

R. #4 Thamesford, Ontario, Canada N0M 2M0 _ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ==== FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ==== ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ===== ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ===== ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.

"TVPredictions.com Newsletter (August 7, 2002) The #1 Newsletter on the Future of TV Hi Everyone, First of all, I want to welcome those subscribers who are getting this newsletter for the first time. Here you will find hard-hitting commentary and analysis on issues related to the future of television. Whether it's Interactive TV, the battle between the cable news networks, the latest in the Emmy race, or the federal government's fight to promote HDTV, TV Predictions will give you the scoop -- before it actually occurs. And, as long-time subscribers will tell you, we pull no punches. (FYI -- TVPredictions.com, based in Los Angeles, is owned and managed by Phillip Swann, author of ""TV dot Interactive Television.""

We rank the 10 companies that are benefiting most from the deployment of new TV technology. This week's Will the FCC approve the Echostar-DIRECTV merger?; why did Cox scale back its Video on Demand plans?; why did Liberty Media buy a cable company in the Netherlands?; and who at NBC is smoking crack? Find out in this all-new edition of... The Interactive TV Power Rankings! =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Ready for this? The next five months could determine whether TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service, ultimately survives as a business. TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock dipped below three this week. And network execs are openly questioning whether the digital recorder, which permits skipping commercials with a few clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising models. There even have been hints that the networks could support a move by the cable industry to offer a PVR that does not permit commercial skipping. And that PVR would not be a TiVo. To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have recommended the service to a friend. And when people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just like the way people say ""Coke"" when they talk about soft drinks. ) But Wall Street, the media and the industry are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start putting some big numbers on the board -- and it needs to do it this holiday season. If it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo until now will run for the hills. That will push the company's stock price down even further. And if that happens, TiVo could have just two Sell the company under duress or wait until its funding dries up. Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch an intensive marketing blitz over the next five months, right through the holiday season. The blitz will include a sharp increase in retail distribution, TV advertising and PR efforts. The company needs to show Wall Street -- and the industry -- that it will be the brand leader in the PVR category. And it needs to show that it can generate mass consumer demand. How does TiVo demonstrate that? Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end will have people questioning whether TiVo has the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching TiVo closely, might decide that adding the service is not such a great selling point after all. And Echostar, which currently does not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide to stay with its unbranded PVR service after its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. (TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV, but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if the merger is approved.) So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided in the next several months. Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve a partial success. The company will boost its subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I also predict it will decide to sell the company to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the necessary funding and industry connections for long-term growth and survival.

"OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made his fortune. Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS. This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using them to make a FORTUNE! Most people have no idea what a Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very substantial income. Heres the SCOOP- When one person or business files suit against another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT. BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these SHOCKING a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. c) The court will not help you to collect it. d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER has to pay all the expenses to find this out. All of a sudden that BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an expense instead of an asset! WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in files and become forgotten. people give up trying. Right now in the United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting other peoples judgments? Thats what we want to tell you. Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost. The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable organizations. Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs! AND, new judgments become available every day. The work is ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.

"Dear Sir, My name is Mr. Obi W, the manager, credit and foreign bills of Eco Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997. Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.

Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings"" come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying and selling something of value. AS SEEN ON NATIONAL Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"". DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. Another long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."" More testimonials later but first, ======= ==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time. 1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success. **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each. Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report. ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."" Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20, in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

How would you like to generate more income through a different avenue? What if it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!! THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!! Here's something which (I trust) will be of interest to you! Please read all of this. This is not something that I would normally look at, except that I read an article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about PayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it would work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had already experienced their efficiency and good standing. You can complete this whole process in one hour and you will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! Did I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the Internet-type fast.' Everything is done on the Internet by E-mail. NEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a little of their time. TESTIMONIALS Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, Hey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of our frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 grand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run this program again........ Mary Gathers, Columbia, Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to you... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said and went on vacation. When I got back, my account was up to over $12,000! I owe you! GETTING STARTED. If you're not already a user, the very first thing you need to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes and PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this program FREE! Here's the BE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO $100 DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!! Then...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note like ""Please add me to your mailing list."" BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED.... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the others to start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received). Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this THREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY HIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see results in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT MONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or more as in other programs). Ideally, you should send them to people who send their programs to you or to personal contacts who are already working on the web, because they know these programs work and they are already believers in the system! Besides, this program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already in another program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long before others even begin to receive letters!

If you already have a PayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 GIFT to the person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list at No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 in your bank account! Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 transaction that you get from PayPal!!! Follow These Simple E-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a note saying ""subscribe me to your mailing list"". Only the first person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. Edit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first place in order to earn money fast! If you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e- mail to then your name will be immediately removed from the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if you add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of people receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! the body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL.

Better yet, you can also earn $5 while you do it. Each time someone signs up for an account and completes the Refer-a-Friend requirements, we'll give you a $5 BONUS! When you send money through Pay Pal, you can fund your payments with your credit card or checking account. You won't have to worry about your privacy, because PayPal keeps your accounting information safe. Making a purchase with PayPal is more secure than mailing a check or giving your credit card number to a stranger. That's why over 9 million people from around the world use PayPal to move money. Signing up for a PayPal account is easy. It takes only a couple of minutes and, if you complete the bonus requirements PayPal will automatically add $5 to your account balance. To learn more about PayPal visit the web site at ""Best of the Web"" -Forbes ""Using the service is actually safer than a check or money order""- Wall Street Journal ""PayPal can play a major role in your life. You can use it to pay for stuff at auction sites, settle dinner debts with friends or nudge your cousin to repay that $50 he borrowed at the family reunion.- Time PS. Does this sound too good?

I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my l= evels dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti= -Aging Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its no= rmal coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of th= is without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taki= ng few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! -Alan Ross, 43 years old GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international uni= ts are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The in= dividual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000n= g per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH= . WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)? Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which = is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the= endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically= similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few= hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones= secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughou= t the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are new= ly made. The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously= dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their orig= inal cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced = to store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the abili= ty to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related= symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased = muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decrease= d mental function and loss of libido. When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the = all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing subs= tance which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the proper dosage amounts. GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, test= osterone, melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are= tiny chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to r= egulate the activities of the vital organs. The word ""hormone"" is derived from a G= reek word meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some= of the effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other = hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatl= y reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, includi= ng making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also helps restore hair color and hair loss. THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH? Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its pr= oduction gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls abou= t 14% per decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is n= ot new, its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and= physicians have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consist= ent results. Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only t= he medical profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another proble= m has been that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had bee= n only effective administered through injections. However, a new technology devel= oped by Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alte= rnative. GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61 Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tes= ted to date. The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half b= y the age of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, = 200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the= ages of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results= in SDS, or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disea= se called aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrenc= e. Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should incl= ude an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen. After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined after 6 or more months of GH _ Improved memory _ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and o= ther organs _ Increased sexual drive and performance _ Increased fertility _ Enhanced immune system _ Quicker wound and fracture healing _ New hair growth and color reparation _ Sharper vision _ Improved exercise performance and tolerance _ Increased muscle mass without exercise _ Reduction of cellulite and fat _ Increased stamina and vitality _ Reduction in high blood pressure _ Improvement in sleep _ Anti-aging _ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing _ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol _ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol _ Strengthening of bones IS GH SAFE? GH has been successfully used in the medical community for over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. Edmond Klein, M.D. and L. Cas Terry Ph.D., tested over 800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that GH had substantial benefits and no side effects. ************************* You're going to receive Anti-Aging Formula for under $150.00...

BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR NAME IN THE #1 POSITION AND THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THIS DOCUMENT. THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.**** As soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM! These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture, you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT plug in your own numbers and see the results. METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports. Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you. $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. **ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.

"Gooday, With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party, Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001. When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, ! En! gland for 9years now. I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my master's money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being. Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you. Yours sincerely, Donald Phiri. --DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam-- This sf.net email is sponsored Welcome to geek heaven.

Please Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) To whom it may concern, I was skeptical when I first read your ad. I grew up in the 70s & 80s. I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then. So I knew my stuff. But drug tests stopped that! Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease. I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea. Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal! I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great! Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say! That is hard to find nowadays in a company. Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius. I will be a customer for life! Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free. And just send the customers to you. Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people. I would prefer the earlier one becau! se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely? This deal would give me my own products and samples for free? You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc.. I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability. It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do! At least I would be able to do something worthwhile. And great products makes it real easy to sell. Let me know what you think? Sincerely, RJ Thank you so much for the Ragga. It is everything you guys claim, and then some! I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements. How nice that this is non-prohibited! It tastes great and feels great too! I am so glad I took a chance and ordered. Blessings to all of you. -- Frankie R. Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff. I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path. I used to have to take Valium in the past. Not anymore with the Temple 3. It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s. I am very satisfied with all of your products. I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure. Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it. Who would have thought?! -- A.J. Finally, we realize of course that this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive . (Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is a very, very Sweet Smoke and sweetness is never acquired inexpensively.

Please Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) To whom it may concern, I was skeptical when I first read your ad. I grew up in the 70s & 80s. I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then. So I knew my stuff. But drug tests stopped that! Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease. I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea. Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal! I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great! Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say! That is hard to find nowadays in a company. Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius. I will be a customer for life! Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free. And just send the customers to you. Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people. I would prefer the earlier one becau! se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely? This deal would give me my own products and samples for free? You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc.. I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability. It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do! At least I would be able to do something worthwhile. And great products makes it real easy to sell. Let me know what you think? Sincerely, RJ Thank you so much for the Ragga. It is everything you guys claim, and then some! I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements. How nice that this is non-prohibited! It tastes great and feels great too! I am so glad I took a chance and ordered. Blessings to all of you. -- Frankie R. Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff. I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path. I used to have to take Valium in the past. Not anymore with the Temple 3. It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s. I am very satisfied with all of your products. I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure. Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it. Who would have thought?! -- A.J. Finally, we realize of course that this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive . (Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is a very, very Sweet Smoke and sweetness is never acquired inexpensively.

By getting clear on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be moving toward and experiencing your highest and best. 1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will have even more to appreciate. 2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly imagine. 3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals. 4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more calories. Eat only small amounts at one time. 5. Read something educational, inspirational or entertaining--preferably all three. 6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the Super-conscious. 7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy. 8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of my book, then write in my journal. 9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible. 10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments (07/27/01) ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~ yes 81% no 19% ~~~~~~~~~ No. This is a funny thing to me. I hear about so many people being super scared to give out their SS#. Well folks, I can get your SS# for 50 cents. Give me a name and address and about 90% of the time I can get the number. We are so worried about putting our credit card number on the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes. They could do who knows what with the CC number. I once had a person tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that person (me) would have her account info and could write a check out for thousands of dollars. I told her to just send it to me then and she said that was OK. Then I asked her to tell me what the difference was between the original check and a fax copy. I told her to ask her lawyer that too. Never heard back from her. The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is available in many places. Have a good day. -- Terry ~~~~~~~~~ Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most importantly, never give any personal information at a site that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put in my credit information in each time instead of having an account in standing, a little more time but less risks involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier! -- Catherine F. ~~~~~~~~~ Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner was in a bad car accident. I had a full service account. My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address went unprotected. A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com address to a porn shop. Thus, I lost 4 years of building up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place on 8 more. This set me back about 4 lost a minimum of $50,000. I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times. The first time I lost almost 4 months of work. Now, I back up often enough to not to lose so much time. This is also Internet theft. These people are nothing but out and out criminals and should spend years behind bars. Customers are well protected from credit card theft; however, merchants can lose a lot of money. I sell only by purchase order and certified or registered company checks. -- Peter S. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED! And the July 'One-Question Survey' WINNER is...

That is a fully retarded view of economics, and pretty much the same kind of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts. There are a bazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state of California messed up and the energy producers exploited. I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like the blackouts is to reregulate. Ultimately we have to blame the people who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and exploitation. Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck? If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't necessarily the answer. You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers. Yes, the people involved were heartless and corrupt. But mainly they just did their jobs. The guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote the rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good rules, pro-deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway. - Lucas",no

"This is for those that have interacted with D Winer ""Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around. You're supposed to just shut up and take it."" =========== Who's the real monster? It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that dares to disagree with him. It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too strong a case. So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're some sort of monsters, violent ones no less. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe. The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving RSS in general. Each with their own brand of attitude, to be sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward. How is that being monstrous? Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's perception of them? If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness. 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand It's really quite pitiful. When normal people don't understand something they usually try learning about it. They read up, ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it. This before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools. What Dave does is just the opposite. Posts a link to something he doesn't understand Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it. Expects others to do research for him Abuses anyone who tries to help him Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy Tries making the educated people look like fools. Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off. Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context. Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1 His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be true. Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web. He'd rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying. One reader wrote to us with a good analogy. ""It's like that movie The Poseidon Adventure. Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow. I don't know about you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room. The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot."" Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around. You're supposed to just shut up and take it. After all, why would good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you? It's all about love, right? To hell with asking you if you want to get shafted. And if you dare complain, he savages you. Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing all the trouble. We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking amongst ourselves about it.

It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support. I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours. Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any deal-stoppers. Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use it! The poor Radio customers! The poor Salon blog users! They're going to be dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use! So with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage!!! Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected! Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card. What utter fucking nonsense. This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his 'blame America' bullshit. Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of RSS. Now he's trying to pretend we should be nice to him because he's still recovering? Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights. We'll still kick your ass regardless. That's what years of your abusing people has gotten you Dave. No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever. 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss Dave is Scary on 9/11 Posted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002: I'll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for Publishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of UserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there's something really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe 9-11.

Here's the patent This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS 1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time. Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!! Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents.

"If you need to store a database password, then clearly the first step is to store the text outside the web tree. You can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere, so that at least an attacker has to get two different things. Also, don't get full privileges - create a user account that is GRANTed very limited access. However, you can often do better than this if security is critical. Create a separate program which has these database keys (as noted above), and make the web program contact IT.

"Lioness adopts fifth antelope Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent Tuesday October 8, 2002 The Guardian Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled wildlife experts. The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday. Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed the natural mothers to feed them. Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by their natural mothers.

"Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded. Entirely mechanical! Definitely not optical at all.

"I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still. There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early 1980s if not before. A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly adequate. It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition) must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes, or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not tried it on extf3 or reiser.) BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of writing to RAID4 or RAID5... I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID? Glenn Everhart -----Original Message----- attacks Hi, I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine. This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine. The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot. When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or ""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.) Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know? I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or no) downtime.

"XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a company looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things, divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very gpl. The results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to put preasure on Sigma to honor the GPL. Some notes from other places.... >>From Doom9 [3] ""XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4 Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project. Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL - which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has been resolved XviD development will not continue. That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now. Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes and kept quiet about the matter at hand. [Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download. However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we might be hearing more about this. [Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX compatible as it was advertised. [Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself) that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different copyright notices which is quite funny."" [1] [2] [3]",no

"Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 07:55 GMT 08:55 UK Lennon killer seeks parole again The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's 62nd birthday. Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980. It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from Attica state prison. At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the ex-Beatle. Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star. Shot dead Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New York City apartment on 8 December 1980. He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice. Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him. The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him before the shooting. 'Deserved death' Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime. Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if Chapman were released. Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled commercial success. The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would have been 62 on Wednesday. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~--> Plan to Sell a Home?

"--- begin forwarded text Clearing Framework , xmlx I'm happy to announce the first public release of NeuDist NeuDist is an Open Source Software framework for building applications for the Neubia Distributed Clearing Platform. This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would primarily be of interest to developers. Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented towards people with experience in Java/XML development. There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available in the next release. The framework currently contains the - Classes for creating ""Named Objects"", which are authenticated using digital signatures within a hierarchy. - Storage framework for ""Named Objects"". - Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet interoperable with other implementations) - Simple SOAP client - Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on ""Named Objects"". - Current types of ""Named Objects"" NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication Framework AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using digital signatures. Next major release is scheduled to - hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level NameSpaces - Signing Implementation of web based signing services End user hosted signing service - Example User Authentication Application - Example Payment System based on NeuDist I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher level documentation about the business side of things.

This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards. They have an internal procession unit around 4MHz. Can we consider them as trusted hardware ?

"SpamAssassin is hurting democracy! Owen Internet can level the political playing field By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in public office. While chances are high that we won't know them personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and ask for our votes. Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters. In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support. That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium. Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones through any of those channels. The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message. His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field. No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters. The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads. When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium. Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient groups. But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information. Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, the former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written for the Los Angeles Times.",no

To my mind there's 3 types of 1. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps when the user closes the account 2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed from them etc. 3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.

As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence. This happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences. That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to have a separate call for ""what sequences are in this folder?"" and ""what messages are in this sequence?"". One option would have been to add another call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time technique would be less error-prone. I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences for all messages. I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday. And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

It doesn't look too hard. Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package did. For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from < to work on it anymore. I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's booty-kicking tokenizer). I'll probably have something soon, like maybe half an hour, and no, it's not too hard. The hard part is storing the data somewhere. I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a person can just drop in with a default Python install. So anydbm is looking like my best option. I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which does the same sort of thing. You call it from procmail, it adds a new header, and then you can filter on that header. Really easy. Here's how I envision this working. Everybody gets four new train-eggs train-spam trained-eggs trained-spam You copy all your spam and eggs* into the ""train-"" boxes as you get it. How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over anything which was misclassified. Then, every night, the spam fairy swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam. After she's done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders. This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read their mail right off the server. I've spoken with some fellows at work about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well. Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to train-eggs"". Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd start showing up in mail clients. That's the ""delete as spam"" button Paul Graham was talking about. * The Hormel company might not think well of using the word ""ham"" as the opposite of ""spam"", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of their product name for things thus far. So I propose we start calling non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as ""eggs"". Neale",no

Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages rather than to the first unseen in the current folder. Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.

"from slate's ""today's papers"": The New York Times and Los Angeles Times both lead with word that a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest national gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01. The judge concluded that El Paso left 21 percent of its capacity in the state off-line, thus driving up the price of gas and helping to induce rolling blackouts. and this is the product of overregulation? -----Original Message----- Hall Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over regulation. The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly. Rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing. As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics. Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better than government regulation itself. And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a watermelon. > -----Original Message----- > Geege > Schuman > > funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally > irresponsible. which do you think is the worse indictment - > overregulation > or overspending? there are many (dickheads) who buy into the > neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of ""liberal"" as ""one who seeks > to > impose both.""",no

Do a wget of a file of known length, in a script that runs ""date"" before and after (or equivalent).

Remember that hardware-level compression is a factor. (The file you wget will probably be precompressed.)

Or even 300. Er, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen's estimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average age of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to think that some the participants may have actually slowed their pace a bit. So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution could easily be in the 3000+ range. Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it were sheer fantasy.

"> (Please feel free to forward this message to other possibly-interested > parties.) Some caveats (in decending order of concern): 1. These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc. Certain RBLs too. I don't think the results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way, shape, or form when running over a public corpus. 2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA tuning and development. 3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off filters. And, of course, there's always progression in technology (by both spammers and non-spammers). The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or SHA-1 of each file). The third problem doesn't really worry me. These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique to spam filtering. Compression corpuses and other performance-related corpuses have their own set of problems, of course. In other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having multiple independent corpuses. Finding better ways to distribute testing and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution (and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin). If you're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus of 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that much work. If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-technique spamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy. And who doesn't get thousands of non-spam every week? ;-) Dan",no

"what takes time and the refund delivery method on the amount. yesh, it's silly to spend $.37 (+ labor and materials) for a $.02 refund, but maybe the only alternative right now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep the money (see john hall below). your mailed refund is a function of bulk. in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service and over-charging. what will probably customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the customer. If it's less, the combined total amount will go to the city as lump sum settlement. in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like their lump sum to go. of courese, they'd have to be notified by mail first. :-) -----Original Message----- Hall They are legally required to do that. I got a similar check because an insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough. It might have been $.02. Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the alternative seems to be to keep the money.

"| I vote for this being added to CVS, any objections?

"I found this interesting, but not very original. Another search engine (can't remember which one tho') was doing this a long time ago. ===== Postcards from Planet Google aggregating them. So what is the world thinking about? JENNIFER 8. LEE At Google's squat headquarters off Route 101, visitors sit in the lobby, transfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the receptionist's et poemes associao brasileira de normas te{AAC}cnicas. The projected display, called Live Query, shows updated samples of what people around the world are typing into Google's search engine. The terms scroll by in English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, French, Dutch, Italian _ any of the 86 languages that Google tracks. The scrolling cigar'' mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto theft fraud how to. Stare at Live Query long enough, and you feel you are watching the collective consciousness of the world stream by. Each line represents a thought from someone, somewhere with an Internet connection. Google collects these queries _ 150 million a day from more than 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer logs millisecond by millisecond. Google is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them. So what is the world thinking about? Sex, for one thing. ``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking at the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. (To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, though less successfully with foreign languages.) Despite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much of its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble to the ``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what they are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of Google's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and protecting the data record. Google's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has given Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has been able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including milzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell which countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and Germany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are far-flung in Judging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost and the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last year. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music and celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a Google engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney Spears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her popularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month. Glancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural girlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list recently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose members was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and fentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages taken by Chechen rebels in late October). The long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney Spears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them understand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she broke up with Justin Timberlake. Google can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more serious nature, immediately. On Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 am local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to 250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific Northwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and CNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, Nostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that Nostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction. But the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive cultural seismic meter. The logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden name'' had surged to the top of the charts. Curious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they were neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes after the hour. As the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. Why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not explain them. That is a paradox of a Google per se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet. ``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a member of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what else is going on in the world.'' So what had gone on on April 22, 2001? That night the million-dollar question on the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had been, ``What was Carol Brady's maiden name?'' Seconds after the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to Google to search for the answer (Tyler), producing four spikes as the show was broadcast successively in each US time zone. The precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some. ``It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said Sergey Brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford helped found Google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. ``It was like a moment-by-moment barometer.'' Predictably, Google's query data respond to television, movies and radio. But the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. One of Google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends before they hit the radar of other media. As such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or retailers. Google is quiet about what if any plans it has for commercialising its vast store of query information. ``There is tremendous opportunity with this data,'' Mr Silverstein said. ``The challenge is defining what we want to do.'' Google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data because of privacy concerns. Searches are logged by time of day, originating IP address (information that can be used to link searches to a specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly _ Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. What is interesting in the aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual. In aggregate form, Google's data can make a stunning presentation. Next to Mr Rae's cubicle is the GeoDisplay, a 40-inch screen that gives a three-dimensional geographical representation of where Google is being used around the globe. The searches are represented by coloured dots shooting into the atmosphere. The colours _ red, yellow, orange _ convey the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. The tallest flames are in New York, Tokyo and the San Francisco Bay area. Each country has a distinctive usage pattern. Spain, France and Italy have a midday lull in Google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely lunches and relaxation. In Japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when phone rates for dial-up modems drop. Google's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and phenomena as they hop from country to country. Take Las Ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in Spain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee-knocking dance similar to the Macarena. Like a series of waves, Google searches for Las Ketchup undulated through Europe over the summer and fall. The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah) has already topped the charts in 18 countries. In late summer, Google's logs show, Las Ketchup searches began a strong upward climb in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. Haven't heard of Las Ketchup? If you haven't, Google predicts you soon will. === rgrds, Bernard IIU mailing list IIU@iiu.taint.org",no

"I'm fairly confused here, with Procmail. I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com. I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything specific on this scenario. Here's the situation. I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah.

Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do for our corporate masters) (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made.

The result, to put it succinctly, is ""nothing"". No forwards go out, no files are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up.

But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g. Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you still can't fit a lot on a CD.

Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap space. Who knows what Windows does internally?) My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could help. I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a product, I'd love to hear about it. Ben",no
"On Mon, Sep 09, 2002 at 11:01:22AM -0700, John Hall > Why so fast? Normal terminal velocity is much slower. Terminal velocity can be calculated by $v_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{CpA}}$ where C is an experimentally determined coefficient, p is the density of the air, and A is the area of the object. These calculations only work if the object is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah. Terminal velocity for a skydiver actually varies with how the diver holds themselves -- you go faster if you pull yourself into a cannonball. That is the ""A"", for the most part. All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that.

Can we consider them as > trusted hardware ? SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed. That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the $1-20 range (depending on the application). As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question. -- Alex Russell alex@SecurePipe.com alex@netWindows.org",no

"How about I believe Tom had it right. Signal not noise. I'll Los Angeles Times September 23, 2002 Monday Copyright 2002 / Los Angeles Times Los Angeles Times September 23, 2002 Monday Home Edition The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a public-policy think tank here. The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an unlikely espresso. That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents, and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is, after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000 residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts. A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,"" said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was common sense."" Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol. Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year. Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues. Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care, improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries. At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink. Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got to come from somewhere."" Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be expected of espresso the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy. Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out. David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I think everyone should pay."" Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises, Starbucks and Tully's. The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a city audit. University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. ""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker] and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care. ""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with the espresso drinkers?"" In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle, corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care. ""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single consumer product."" The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee. The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt. Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso. It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""

"PlayStation owners win copyright case Owners of PlayStation consoles who modify their machines to play games bought overseas have had a win in the Federal Court. Sony Computer Entertainment has failed in its claim that ""chipping"" breaks copyright laws. Sony launched legal proceedings against a Sydney man, Eddy Stevens, for allegedly selling pirated games and also providing and installing modification chips. PlayStation consoles in Australia are different from those in the US and Japan because of the different television formats. The court was told ""chipping"" allows people to play legitimately bought overseas games and copies of games, but also pirated games. The judgement by Federal Court Justice Ronald Sackville says Sony failed to prove that PlayStation consoles have a copyright protection measure installed in the first place and therefore could not rule that a mod chip breaks copyright legislation. Mr Stevens was found to have infringed trademark rules in relation to the pirated games he sold a matter which will come before the court again next month.",no

A lot of C++ programmers, myself included, were /not/ complaining about gcc's stricter adherence to the specification (which, by the way, a lot of kernel programmers complain about with gcc 3.x -- at least, the patch authors I've talked to hate gcc 3) -- gcc ""2.96"" had a lot of bugs.

"Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you all. Thanks for your suggestions. Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU fan. I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg£133.86) but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on. It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3½"" drive bays so I should be ok for future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box is big and has loads of room inside. Oh... and it looks very cool :-) However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says * Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted! * ATX Power supply sold separately In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately. Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from that show) but I missed that :-) I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.

That doesn't matter. What does matter is that they were going on phenotypes, and didn't engineer the genetics. That example makes a good case for natural selection, but not for artificial.

"I can't see it either. I do however disagree with Joe in that it needs to be 2+MPixels to be useful. Value is not always necessarily defined by quality (just look at 802.11). If I had a self-contained communications unit that let me share etc. and it fit in my pocket then it might encourage me to share those things more often. If we're talking on the phone and you ask me what the weather is like and I say ""hang on"", outstretch the device with my arm extended, press a button, and instantly send you a picture on me with blue sky in the background, that has value. But if I say ""hang on"", fumble around in my briefcase for a digital camera, and after 5 minutes of plugging and praying with USB finally am able to take a photo of me, bound by several feet of cable and multiple devices, well, that doesn't really have value. If I'm a Paparazzi I'd love to be able to send high-res photos using my mobile phone because that has real economic impact, and I could put up with the hassle for the amount of time it saves me. However, I don't think that is the market that Sprint PCS is contemplating. The fact that Sprint has not made the assumption that both the sender and recipient of the picture are using their mobile phones will help this survive. Gets around the whole ""fax"" problem (where both sender and receiver have to have faxes in order for that technology to be useful). On the whole, not very useful for regular Joes (pun intended).

"Hi folks, Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, but I am trying to do on my linux desktop what I used to do with some other os software. I'm trying to use a combination of some bash scripts and some perl to generate reports from a couple of ascii files. Eventually these will run on a server and get the files by ftp, analyse them and mail me the results. As I'm no programmer (by any stretch of the imagination !) I'm getting a bit lost. I can deal with single files (eventually) using grep, egrep, awk, and a nice perl script called 'total' which i found while googling. Problem now is that the data I'm trying to report on is split between two isam files. File 1 contains Docket Number, Line Number, Item, quantity, price, duedate File 2 contains Docket Number, Customer, Shipping date, invoice number. To make some sense of the data, I need to relate the Docket number between the 2 files, so that I can generate a report by customer. My first reaction is to look at mysql, and import the ascii data into 2 tables so that I can use sql queries. Is this the way to go, or should I delve a bit deeper into perl ? Any advice welcome.

Yeah, I get that. I just think this is a poor example. Corporate bankruptcy is a power fight between creditors, management, and shareholders over control of assets. Because a corporation is incorporeal (hee, hee), it can't be much else. If you're concerned about the imbalance of power related to corporations, I think the more relevant areas are tax structures, especially the income tax, various forms of externality, law related to employment, corporate transparency, and corporate governance.

A theory (in this case, that fantasy was the propagating force/drive?) behind a given act, that from those not in the fantasy seems morally outrageous, repugnant or unjustified.

You're assuming too much, dearie. His was all a psychological game. I'd be willing to wager that, his point was merely psychological. That there is a distinguishing characteristic (the fantasy) about those who are perpetually deluded into a preconceived notion of how the world needs to work -- his examples were very clear -- a psychopathological individual and on a lesser extreme, the father who fantasizes his son as a football player. I kinda read 'levels' into that distinguishing characteristic though. Meaning, just because you believe in the/a fantasy, does not mean necessarily that you're going to be an evil terrorist. It just means you're playing alittle game in your head, and because of that you are a bit different from the rest of the wavelengths floating around in the cosmos at that moment.

I didn't read cleanse or nonhuman anywhere. Mind telling me where you saw those words? Sure, I'll bite that the article had rhetoric. I'll also bite that he wasn't fair entirely with his theory. If he meant it to be a universal (capable of including even the common father with a football complex dream) he should have included our delusions in all of this. But honestly, where in the hell did you get 'cleanse ourselves of 'them', the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects... ? GLM> What else shall we call it? Just anti-liberal? Lots of things can be anti-liberal and not be bad. :) GLM> Better GLM> are the same everywhere in the Universe? What if Al Queda is in fact GLM> more like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? Well, as sinister as the schoolboard is, they didn't go kill 4k+ people. Lets put some of this moral relativism de jour into perspective here. Al'Qaeda had a fantasy. This fantasy involved a whole mess of 'others' not in their collective fantasy. This _is_ much like the mafia's collective fantasy about brotherhood and organized crime, or the biker gang's fantasy about being badasses on the road or the school board's fantasy about indoctrinating your children with Jesus, but its not equivalent. The terrorists went out, and purposely destroyed things, and killed people. This is bad, I don't care what universe you're in. While the aspect of 'fantasy' can be applied to all groups, and that label can be equivalent, the perpetration of the fantasy has different effects and must be judged differently. Otherwise, whats a genocide? Just a father-son complex gone terribly awry? GLM> What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima GLM> gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this GLM> planet? They just may, that doesn't dispute that their fantasy was a deadly one.

GLM> When both sides can call the other ""evil"" to the cheers of their local GLM> public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark. So your whole point is we too live in a fantasy. Sure. No questions. Its the thing that bothered me about the article. I think the difference between our fantasy and theirs, is that there are folks out there, in our fantasy allowed to voice their opinons about the 'fantasy' and keep folks a bit grounded in the real versus the made-up. From what I gather, there are no such guards, or protections on their end. Thats the problem with some regeimes over others. THey all have bad points -- Ours is in a collective fantasy that we need to control the oil, masking the intentions behind a very clever, albiet convienent other fantasy of 'terrorism'.

"Rohit forwards from the > Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on Retailers > August 12, 2002 > By KATE MURPHY I can't imagine why they're inching forward through 13- and then 14- digit extensions; seems they should just leap ahead to something with real headroom, say 40-digit numbers (128 bits or more). How hard can it be to widen the glyph area and narrow the bars? The sensors have got to be tens or even hundreds of times more accurate/robust than when barcodes first took off.

"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com): > What is the GPL all about then? (1) I'm sure you are not _actually_ under the delusion that everything on a typical Linux distribution issued subject to the terms of the GNU GPL. For one thing, it seems difficult to imagine you _not_ being aware that XFree86 is under the X/MIT licence, that Perl is under the Perl Artistic Licence, that Apache is under the Apache licence, and that numerous BSD utilities are under the BSD licence. Furthermore, xv, Acrobat Reader, pine, pico, Netscape Communicator, and a whole slew of other applications typically included aren't under any open source licence at all, but rather are proprietary. (2) You seem, in any event, to be under a misconception as to what the GPL provides, as to code under its umbrella. It says (in part) that _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of covered binary code, then you may insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source code. Please note that it does _not_ guarantee you any rights whatsoever if nobody's decided to give you a lawful copy. > But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not theirs to BSD! Again, you seem to be under a misconception. If you check, I'm quite confident you'll see that SuSE are in full compliance with GPL v. 2's source-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their distribution. And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms to someone else's copyrighted property. But you have not cited any reasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things. > Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp > version, but surely they can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy > and giving it to me? See below. You and the CD owner would be committing copyright violation. SuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you down to a judge, if that's what you're asking. > Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I'm not > asking for that. I'm asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to > burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable > consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a > couple of pints?). You appear confused between Linux the kernel (which is a copyrighted work to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if you've received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather imprecise concept of a ""Linux distribution"", which is a number of works under diverse licence terms collected onto some media. In the case of SuSE's boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate and redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the applications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are proprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG. In the general case, duplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is copyright infringement. Illegal. No amount of hand-waving about the GNU GPL is going to change that. (SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the ""evaluation"" and ""live-eval"" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not ""for value"".)

You have multiple generations of peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a human parts of the property package. The problem in the Philippines is that the landowner class is fading, but the peasants are still operating under the old economic assumption even though it isn't being imposed on them in most cases. In a number of areas, you have landowners that don't use their lands during bad years (i.e. when sugar prices fall too low or some other condition that makes planting unprofitable in the global economy) and in some cases have all but abandoned them, but when they come back to plant crops several years later they find the same peasants living on the fallow land as scratch farmers to survive and waiting for the landowner to come back and give them something to do. The government's solution to this was to ""redistribute"" fallow land to the peasants that lived on them, and created a number of problems in the process. First of all, it meant that all the agricultural producers had to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) or the government would seize the land and give it to someone else, which is not economically optimal by any means. Second when they give it to the peasants, they use it to become scratch farmers, which is not a particularly productive economic activity, and the landowners generally let them do that for free when the land is fallow anyway. Third, the peasants generally *prefer* to work for the landowner rather than own the land themselves; they make more money, have more opportunities to become middle-class, and enjoy a better lifestyle under that arrangement. So the result of all this is that the landowners either run an economically sub-optimal agriculture business to protect their lands, or they risk having their land seized without compensation and given to the peasants/squatters who will gladly sell it back to the plantation owner rather than becoming scratch farmers, another economically sub-optimal solution. The only real role of the government in this arrangement is to be a drag on the economy. And I don't know about 20 years for land titles in the Philippines. It takes a little longer than in the US (though not much), and you may have to bribe someone to make it work well in an expedited manner, but it isn't that onerous in the regions I'm familiar with.

"NRI Number One Expats help Hindi films make dollars and sense even at their own expense By JEANNE E. FREDRIKSEN The expatriate in films is nothing new. Casablanca starring Humphrey Bogart as the suave, mysterious Rick in Morocco remains the top favorite 60 years after its release in America. Although expat characters' lives are traditionally painted as being extraordinary, the simple fact that they live ""elsewhere"" adds a sense of adventure, a dash of romance, and a bit of wishful longing. However, expats have never made the kind of impact on films that non-resident Indians (NRIs) have with Hindi cinema, both at the box office and on the big screen. According to India's 2001 census, the country's population exceeded the 1 billion persons milestone, and there are approximately 11 million Indians living, working, and studying elsewhere around the world. NRIs have become a serious market for the Hindi film industry, particularly in the U.K., where approximately 3 percent of the population is Indian/Pakistani, and in the U.S., where 1.7 million out of 281.5 million people are Indian. The rupee box office is now augmented quite handsomely by the dollar-and-pound box office, much to the delight of directors and producers. Among the films reporting a half-to-three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar box office in the U.S. or the U.K. are Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai (2000), Refugee (2000), Lajja (2001), and Asoka (2001). The NRI ""million-dollar-box-office club"" boasts such films as Yaadein (2001) and Lagaan (2001) in the U.S. Taal (1999), Hum Saath Saath Hain (HSSH, 1999), and Mohabbatein (2000) made the mark or better in the U.K. Taal and HSSH doubled their U.K. intakes in the U.S. and brought in $2 million each. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) tallied up $2.6 million in the U.K. Most recently, setting a new high-water mark in the overseas box office, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G, 2001) grabbed the No. 10 spot its first week of release in the U.S. and earned $2.9 million during its five-week run. In the U.K., K3G earned nearly $3.6 million over an 18 week run. Impressive? Yes, considering that promotion of Hindi films outside of the Indian community is virtually zero, although that may be on the brink of changing slightly. If nothing else, the figures indicate that the NRI spends a big chunk of change on the films. During the past decade, the inclusion of NRI characters in both commercial and non-commercial films has been on the rise, and in a circular logic, it's only natural that they have become a part of these films' stories. Each NRI touches someone in India, and these ""global Indians,"" as filmmaker Subhash Ghai has called them, cannot be shrugged off as a passing phase. Films featuring or ""made for"" NRIs have been criticized by some in India, but in reality, many of those films have performed extremely well at the Indian box office. Could this speak to the lure of adventure and the romance of the NRI? The first Hindi blockbuster to spotlight NRI characters was Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ, 1995), the story of two young people who grew up Indian in London. DDLJ introduced us to the mischievous, prank-pulling Raj, who in the beginning fails to graduate but succeeds in pilfering a case of beer from an Indian-owned convenience store. In the end, he steadfastly applies Indian sensibilities in his pursuit of the rebellious-but-trapped Simran as her unwanted arranged marriage approaches. Very possibly, because of this juxtaposition of traits, attitudes, and events, DDLJ enjoys the distinction of being the longest-continually-running film in Indian cinema history. Popularity aside, there is the ongoing issue regarding accuracy in the characterization of NRIs in films. Often they are drawn as stereotypes, which are easy to lean on, requiring neither depth nor dimension. Because of this, Hindi filmmakers may be said to straddle the border separating East and West, staying securely at home and dipping into their highly-fantasized world of the Indian diaspora. In many cases, commercial Hindi films present an overly-devised sense of the NRI as being either corruptly-Westernized or as being more homesick than a child gone away to camp for the first time. While these concepts may carry a certain truth, the corresponding misconceptions come from the minds of the at-home Indians, who wag a seemingly-envious finger at the NRI's ability to exist in two mobility, the other offering traditions and history. Pompous, materialistic, alcohol-drinking, cigarette-smoking, drug-taking, affair-having, spoiled brats The first Hindi film I saw was Subhash Ghai's Pardes (1997). Despite encouraging me to see more films, it made me wonder if ""NRI"" actually meant ""Not Really Indian."" If the NRI characters weren't silly, whiney troublemakers, they were mean and nasty, embracing every possible negative human quality in stark contrast to the pristine Kusum Ganga. Even the dialogue and song lyrics in the film were designed to instruct the viewer that the West is inferior but one can still bring India back into one's life. The film is propaganda at its finest and filled with relentless reminders of good vs. evil, purity vs. corruption, right vs. wrong, traditional vs. modern in short India vs. the West. But this is not where the negativity ends. Very often, there is a ""dress code"" for the female characters to help the viewer understand her measure of purity or traditionally-dressed, the more Indian the woman. Unsurprisingly, this does not seem to carry over to the men's characters. Running alongside this can be the ""training guide"" in which NRIs are constantly reeducated that ""This is not India ,"" ""This is not America ,"" ""Only in India ,"" ""This is our culture."" The repetition seems less designed to be a natural part of life than to foster reinforcement, as if NRIs are too ignorant to appreciate it the first time. When Indians achieve success and wealth, have large homes, and own their companies in these films, they are industrious, clever, and respected businessmen. The NRI equivalent is held up to a double standard and considered materialistic. Even the printed synopsis of Taal in the Eros Entertainment/B4U DVD booklet refers to the NRI characters' ""world of ruthless materialism."" On the other hand, the Mumbai-based, plagiarizing Vikrant Kapoor character is likeable enough and presented as an opportunist, which seems to be a step up. Italy is an unlikely origin for an NRI and offspring in a Hindi film, but Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (2000) filled the bill. For all the film's splendor, it was regrettable that the Indo-Italian Sameer was presented as a naïve, bumbling nerd who had little going for him beyond his singing ability. Yaadein gave us a kind and loving, if slightly confused, single parent from London raising three daughters who suffer enough issues to put a therapist into a tailspin. As if that weren't enough, the film includes an American-raised brat who wants nothing to do with parents, settling down, or having babieshardly the ideal Indian bride-to-be. And what happens when a married NRI couple splits into the ""modern"" vs. the ""old-fashioned?"" The wife is tossed out like the garbage and sent home to India as punishment for being unreceptive to having affairs outside of marriage. Such is the initial setup for Lajja, Rajkumar Santoshi's look into the world of Indian women. Show me the way to go home The other extreme of NRIs in film is the homesick, culture-craving, more-patriotic-than-thou Indian. Building their own mini-Indias for maxi-memories, this NRI portrayal takes a real issue and magnifies it to unreal proportions. And no film illustrates that as extravagantly as the lush and sumptuous Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (K3G). Not only did K3G enjoy a healthy run at home, it exploded worldwide onto theater screens in Indian communities last December and played to packed houses for weeks. And K3G is a film in which everythinghomes, transportation, finances, fashion, holidays, events, emotions, and tearssets a new standard for the term ""larger-than-life."" In K3G, much of the post-interval footage takes place in England. For Anjali, life in London simmers with a patriotic zeal and an all-consuming homesickness manifested in the meticulous maintenance of Indian customs and rituals while she separates herself from her surroundings. Her need for India is so overwhelming that she relies on the false protection of mocking people and places outside of her own family and home. Overkill? Certainly, as writer-director Karan Johar's inflated representation of what have become some of the filmi passions of the typical NRI. But when it boils down to the common denominators without the fanfare, flash, and fervor, even those who move across country miss their families and familiar surroundings; one always retains a credible amount of home-turf loyalty; and if one's heritage is lost, the person is rendered as no more than a racial statistic. ""Those living in India are surrounded by our culture every minute, even if they don't realize it,"" says Vivek Malhotra, a thirty-something NRI and business owner in the Chicago area. ""Here it's different, but we will always be Indian,"" he continues, striking at the heart of the perceived problem. ""Sometimes, I feel that the movies think we've forgotten that. Maybe the filmmakers should spend some time finding out who we are. I really don't think they have a clue."" On the upside is a beneficial aspect for the children of NRIs. ""It's good that these films show our kids what happens in Indiathe traditions, customs, values,"" says Parag Gandhi, a long time theater owner and promoter of Hindi films in Chicago. ""They may be modernized in India, but the traditional values remain."" And many popular films target the late-teens, twenty-something demographic. ""Films such as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, and K3G,"" adds Gandhi, ""are examples of films that are half traditional, half modern, striking a balance between the two for all of the markets."" Another positive consideration is that not all films show NRIs in a questionable light. Caricatures of NRIs have been challenged in commercial films like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Dil Chhata Hai (2001), Monsoon Wedding (2001), and the recent Kitne Door Kitne Paas, all of which present NRIs as more realistic, more human characters. Aa Ab Laut Chalen offers a variety of NRI personalities from the selfish, the conniving, and the party animal to the lovable cabbies and the pandit-cop who make the best of their situations without complaint. Interestingly, the film also dares to include shop owners, Dunkin' Donuts clerks, gas station corporate crises, or overseas judgments. The U.S., the U.K., and Australia are represented in Bombay Boys (1999) by three young men coming/returning to Bombay, India for personal reasons. In a refreshing reversal of the typical attitude concerning NRIs in film, the boys are the ""good"" Indians, and everyone they meet has some relationship with the darker side of the city. At its most basic, the film shows that if something is lost, it won't necessarily be found in India. Even the non-commercial, multi-award-winning Bawandar (2001) incorporates an NRI as a connecting thread in the piecing together of Sanvri Devi's story. Curious, passionate about women's rights, the Indo-English journalist represents the fact that the story has a wider interest than a small, rural village. Stepping outside of the Hindi film industry for a moment, the English/Telegu film Hyderabad Blues (1998) and the English/Tamil film MitrMy Friend (2002), both smaller-budget films built on delivering messages without preaching, deserve mention. The former engages in the questioning of, rather than the criticism of, East vs. West, and the latter examines the challenges faced by women, NRIs, and their families. The characters and stories of both films enjoy respect in their presentation, partially due to the existence of layered issues that are revealed and resolved (or not) without finger-snapping swiftness or clichéd answers. Hyderabad Blues enjoyed a 31-week run in Mumbai alone, and MitrMy Friend is currently one of the most-rented films in Indian communities in the U.S. While the inclusion of NRIs in Hindi films does not guarantee box office success outside of India, it does send a strong signal that filmmakers acknowledge this constantly growing and lucrative audience sector. If the big-budget, big box-office commercial films coming out of Mumbai often seem to bite one of the hands that feeds it, has the box office anywhere been adversely affected? Well no, not by any charted reports that can be found. And that, itself, sends a loud and clear message back to the industry in Nevertheless, when filmmakers who see NRIs as falling only to the evil side of Western ways look beyond their assumptions, perhaps they will discard their reliance on stereotypes and start paying their overseas family an increased measure of respect. And when filmmakers who take the homesick and patriotic themes beyond believability analyze their own feelings, perhaps they will realize that what NRIs hold dear in their hearts is no different from what those at home should be proud of. n Variety Magazine online archives. Not all Hindi films abroad report box office, and not all box office reports are available. Jeanne E. Fredriksen writes from Chicago. She is family with, friends with, acquainted with, and works for NRIs with an amazing variety of personalities, attitudes, hopes, dreams, goals, livelihoods, needs, wants, and beliefs. ========================================= Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge So globally successful is the film that in 1999 it warranted a billboard outside Shinjuku train station in Tokyo, Japan, announcing its screenings sponsored by India Center there. Shinjuku is the entertainment center of Tokyo, and there is plenty of high-profile competition for attention, attendance, and box office. In Japan, where Indian films enjoy a certain popularity with the natives, the country's 1995 population census of 125.6 million persons showed only 4,244 were Indian with an additional 13,589 being other South Asians. Without question, DDLJ continues to be a favorite whenever, wherever offered for viewing. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham According to a report in the South China Morning Post in January, 2002, all screenings of K3G in December, 2001, were sell-outs in Hong Kong, while pirated copies of the film were the hottest items circulating on the island. Hong Kong's 2001 population census of 6.3 million people revealed that 18,543 were Indian and another 23,581 were Nepalese and Pakistani. K3G's popularity in the Special Administrative Region was impressive because Hong Kong enjoys being the third-largest producer of films by volume after India and the U.S. Bhansali's Musical Heaven By ANIRUDDH CHAWDA DEVDAS (Universal, 2002). Hindi film soundtrack. For perhaps the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas had to deliver a score that not only met the hype but also let Ismail Darbar prove that the mega-selling Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam was no one-time flash in the pan. By devising a semi-classical, once-in-a-decade, 100 percent ""Indian"" musical score, Bhansali and Darbar emerge victorious in baking and serving a 10-layer monumental soundtrack. What is most groundbreaking is the powerful one-two punch of lyrics by newcomer Nusrat Badr and the from-soul-voice of first-timer Shreya Ghosal. Ghosal's voice, reminiscent of both Suman Kalyanpur with a slightly thicker pitch and Anuradha Paudwal without the nasal monotone, is the most original singing voice since Kavita Subramaniam appeared in the Mangeshkar mold. Ghosal's ""Silsila ye chaahat ka"" is a sultry tabla-dominated opening to 52 minutes of sheer musical bliss. ""Maar daala"" (Subramaniam, KK) is an excellent example of the use of classical ragas to complement, rather than fill-in, interludes between verses. On ""Kahe chhed,"" Pandit Birju Maharaj, using his own tune, adds an intoxicating opening for Madhuri Dixit's vocals and Subramaniam to finish out a piercing song of longing. While a combination of Ghosal and Subramaniam give life to on-screen lip-synching for Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai, on the male side Udit Narayan fronts for Shah Rukh Khan. Narayan's on-target ""Bairi piya,"" a duet with Ghosal, could find company in many Lata-Rafi duets of yore. The up-tempo ""Chalak chalak"" again smoothly floats Narayan with Vinod Rathod and Ghosal while Subramaniam and Ghosal's jugalbandhi on ""Dola re dola"" simply shakes the rafters. Packaged in Universal's Bombay plant, the earliest CD pressings have a cheap, paper-thin casing. Purists may consider replacing the cheap cover with a store-bought sturdier one. At a suggested Bombay retail value of about $2 and selling like hot cakes stateside for $10 a pop, Devdas is without doubt a huge profit-maker for the multinational music marketer. But buyers exceptional music and exceptionally well-recorded CD deserve unadulterated musical glory.

The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam, apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.

"This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by luke@applix.com. The mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice. The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing. The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy. We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11. luke@applix.com After Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil Liberty August 4, 2002 By THE NEW YORK TIMES This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil A. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. In the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John Ashcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal government and ""every available statute"" to hunt down and punish ""the terrorists among us."" The roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with wartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions of more than 1,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or fighting for the enemy. The government's effort has produced few if any law enforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been released or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held. But it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being waged in federal courthouses around the country, that experts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance between individual liberties and national security. The main combatants are the attorney general and federal prosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders, immigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil libertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other, with federal judges in between. The government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As it has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits, the courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed back, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's tactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them. Federal judges have, however, allowed the government to hold two American citizens without charges in military brigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map for how they might even challenge their detentions. In the nation's history, the greatest battles over the reach of government power have occurred against the backdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current restrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by historical standards and in light of the risks the nation faces. The current struggle centers on three sets of issues. People held simply for immigration violations have objected to new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret, and they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on what they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. People brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those thought to have information about terrorist plots, have argued that they should not be held to give testimony in grand jury investigations. Finally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two Americans labeled ""enemy combatants"" for what the government contends is more direct involvement with terrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be fundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's representation and a chance to challenge their detentions before a civilian judge. So far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered secret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny, and on Friday a federal district judge in Washington ordered that the identities of most of the detainees be made public under the Freedom of Information Act. ""Secret arrests,"" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the decision on Friday, ""are a concept odious to a democratic society."" A senior Justice Department official said the detentions had been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to ""prove a negative"" and cite specific terrorist acts that had been disrupted. But he said that department officials believed that the detentions had ""incapacitated and disrupted some ongoing terrorist plans."" Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on whether the government may jail material witnesses while they wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In Virginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow Mr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. ""I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer them on, because they are doing exactly what an independent judiciary should be doing,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor at the University of Minnesota and former executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ""It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply skeptical."" These lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet been tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that appeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more sympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments. The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance, reversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a lawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider additional evidence and arguments. But even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the government's sweeping argument that the courts have no role in reviewing the government's designation of an American citizen as an enemy combatant. The detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of the Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were cabdrivers, construction workers or other types of laborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before being cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. Last month, at a conference held by a federal appeals court, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the Clinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant attorney general under President Bush, saying that the administration's refusal to identify the people it had detained reminded him of the ""disappeareds"" in Argentina. ""I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the mothers marching in the streets asking for the names of those being held by the government,"" Mr. Christopher said. ""We must be very careful in this country about taking people into custody without revealing their names."" Mr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from Vietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was taken away in 1975 for ""re-education."" In contrast, he said, those detained by the United States were not being secretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek lawyers. ""These are not incognito detentions,"" he said. ""The only thing we will not do is provide a road map for the investigations."" According to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than 1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on immigration charges. Officials said recently that 81 remained in detention. Court papers indicate there were about two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other detainees were held on various state and federal criminal charges. President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected foreign terrorists before military tribunals, though no such charges have been brought yet. Last month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding in Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a British citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his shoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very establishment of those tribunals ""has the effect of diminishing the American jury, once the central feature of American justice."" Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, institutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all - it has taken place without engaging any broad public interest whatsoever."" Jack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the University of Chicago Law School, have written that the Bush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to civil liberties especially compared with changes during the times of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What has changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil liberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. The Secrecy U.S. Says Hearings Are Not Trials Ten days after last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the nation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping instructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out to be more than 600 ""special interest"" immigration cases. ""Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all other cases on the docket,"" Judge Creppy wrote. ""The courtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no family, and no press."" ""This restriction,"" he continued, ""includes confirming or denying whether such a case is on the docket."" The government has never formally explained how it decided which visa violators would be singled out for this extraordinary process, and it has insisted that the designations could not be reviewed by the courts. But as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and Muslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for example at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious neighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that only a few of these detainees had any significant information about possible terrorists. As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of legal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking legal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have ordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable skepticism about the government's justifications for its detention policies generally. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the hardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on violations that in the past would not have resulted in incarceration. ""Preventive detention,"" he said, ""is such a radical departure from constitutional traditions that we certainly shouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice Department's say-so."" Malek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had it not given rise to one of the legal challenges that threatens to end the secret proceedings. Mr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa 14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than a decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven an ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him about a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr. Zeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa soon cost him 40 days in custody. When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his detention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr. Zeidan's cousin and reporters. The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal court, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers. In March, the government dropped the ""special interest"" designation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond, and the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration charges against him will be considered in the fall. ""You're one of the lucky ones,"" his lawyer, Regis Fernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other visa violators were held as long as six or seven months before being deported or released. Mr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy, which focused on openness, forced the government's hand. ""The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,"" Mr. Fernandez said. ""We figured if the public had access to these hearings they would see that nothing went on except multiple adjournments and delay."" Through a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An I.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's case and in similar cases. He said the immigration service had always detained people without bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He added that the agency had no choice now but to detain a visa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was sure the person was not involved in terrorism. ""Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days and then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he was a terrorist,"" the official said. The newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once reached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers contain one of the fullest accounts of its position on secrecy and executive power. Its main argument is that the courts have no role because immigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely administrative hearings that can be closed at will. Bennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he was flabbergasted by this suggestion. ""A trial is a trial,"" he said. ""A person's liberty is at stake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being told where to live."" But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases, Dale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for counterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I., outlined the reasoning behind the government demand for total secrecy. ""Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous in isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist groups,"" he said. This rationale for withholding information, sometimes called the mosaic theory, is controversial. ""It's impossible to refute,"" Professor Kirtley said, ""because who can say with certainty that it's not true?"" In May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal district court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan, ruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation hearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is able to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case basis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the month before, though that case involved only a single detainee. The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge Bissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court, which will hear arguments in September, declined to do that. A number of news organizations, including The New York Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in support of the newspapers. The government then asked the United States Supreme Court to stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively unusual move given that the case was not before it for any other purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting that it might have more sympathy for the government's arguments. The Witnesses Rights Violated, Lawyers Contend Late on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled two nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul Mohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They were carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000 in cash and had also shaved their body hair. The agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used box cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and had received letters instructing them to ""shave excess hair from the body."" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said there was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian men were involved in, or ""were associated"" with, those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. But even though government officials told reporters that the men had been detained as material witnesses, their lawyers now say that they were held last fall only on immigration violations. The distinction is important because a material witness warrant brings the automatic appointment of a government-paid lawyer, while the government does not have to supply a visa violator with counsel. As a result, the authorities were able to question each of the men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer present, their current lawyers say. Like some of the people who were picked up as material witnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails in New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr. Azmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did, their lawyers say. ""It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never bring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,"" Mr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an interview. ""It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney at the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S. investigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main inquiry into the World Trade Center debacle."" Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his client was interrogated ""often times for several hours a day, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire questions from three or four different people."" Eventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men of any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in June in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting sentencing. Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men consented to questioning. Each ""was read and waived his Miranda rights before each interview,"" prosecutors wrote, adding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses. The United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey, would not comment on the specific cases, but said generally of the government's any rule, regulation, or law. ""I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,"" he said. ""But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every available tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole field and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole field. ""We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate and disrupt,"" he added. Today, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen material witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being detained. But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred intense criticism. Last April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law ""to detain people who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in order to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of the statute."" Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when witnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for grand jury investigations. ""Since 1789,"" Judge Scheindlin said, ""no Congress has granted the government the authority to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that he will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal investigation."" Then last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the government's use of the material witness statute in grand jury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's reasoning. Judge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief Justice John Marshall that ""the public has a right to every man's evidence,"" held that detentions of material witnesses during investigations are proper. The War Captives No Lawyers Allowed Under U.S. Label Yasser Esam Hamdi, a Saudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably an American citizen by virtue of having been born in Louisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind of role the nation's courts should have, if any, in reviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged with something akin to a war crime. Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in Norfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal judges who has shown resistance to the government's approach that once someone is declared an ""enemy combatant"" by the president, all judicial review ceases. Judge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan, has twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and ordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal public defender, to be allowed to visit him without government officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar said that ""fair play and fundamental justice"" require it. He said the government ""could not cite one case where a prisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United States District Court, who was held incommunicado and indefinitely."" But the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge Doumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the government's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and, more important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of foreign and military affairs. ""The authority to capture those who take up arms against America belongs to the commander in chief,"" Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at the breadth of what the government was asserting when he asked the Justice Department's lawyer, ""You are saying that the judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's stature as an enemy combatant?"" The government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide the court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by which they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant. But the government has argued that judges cannot argue with the standards. Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the government closely on those standards. The case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far as that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge to normal judicial procedures. Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like Mr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig after having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike Mr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield by the military but on United States soil by civil law enforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. After his detention as a material witness based on suspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and information to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred to military custody. ""This is the model we all fear or should fear,"" said Mr. Dunham, the public defender. ""The executive branch can arrest an American citizen here and then declare him an enemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the courts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him or giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any evidence.""

"This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. Let's see... a decimal digit is about 3.33 bits, so this is all about moving from a 36-bit to a 46-bit addressing system. Kind of makes the debate about IPv6 spaces quite real, as well as the Auto-ID center at MIT's proposal for a physical markup language. Actual barcode size may yet decline to the point that 2-D codes may yet make it an individual-item level of addressing.

Are angle brackets really the key to immortality? :-> Interesting reinforcement of the Voyager piece I archived earlier today... RK khare@alumni.caltech.edu Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on Retailers August 12, 2002 By KATE MURPHY In a little more than two years, retailers in the United States and Canada will face a deadline that promises technological challenges akin to the Year 2000 computer problem. Starting Jan. 1, 2005, the 12-digit bar codes retailers use to identify everything from cars to candy bars will go to 13 digits. The additional number (and associated bars and spaces) is enough to make checkout scanners seize up and make computers crash, perhaps disrupting entire supply chains. But many retailers have yet to focus on a problem that will require significant investments in time and capital. ""Most retailers are public companies that tend to live quarterly and not look ahead, which means they are going to be hit over the head with this and have to scramble at the last minute to avert disaster,"" said Thomas Friedman, president of Retail Systems Research Services, a company in Newton, Mass., that publishes a retail information technology newsletter. Leading retailers say they have begun to address the issue. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, said the company had ""embraced the concept"" of an expanded bar code, but he did not respond to questions about actual measures taken to prepare computer databases and logistical systems. Similarly, a spokesman for the Target Corporation said his company was ""intellectually ready"" for the change but refused to comment on whether any of its stores or warehouses were technologically ready. But Richard A. Galanti, the chief financial officer of Costco Wholesale, admitted, ""The truth is, given the timeline, everybody's still in the assessment phase, trying to figure out what to do."" The difficulty is similar to the one posed by the Year 2000 computer problem, when computer software had to be switched from two-digit entries identifying years to four-digit entries. Before Jan. 1, 2000, millions of lines of code had to be rewritten to avoid widespread computer failures. Bar codes have been used in packaging since 1974, when the first item, a pack of chewing gum, was scanned at a supermarket in Ohio. The codes identify a product, distinguishing between an eight-ounce can of Del Monte creamed corn and a medium-size pair of Hanes boxer shorts. When a bar code is scanned, the information in the store's database lets the retailer assign a price and track sales and inventory. ""The bar code is the linchpin upon which everything in retail depends,"" Mr. Friedman said. The reason for expanding the 12-digit bar code, known as the Universal Product Code, is twofold. First, there is a shortage of U.P.C. numbers. ""There's only a certain amount of 12-digit numbers, and we're going to run out,"" said John Terwilliger, vice president of global markets at the Universal Code Council, a nonprofit organization based in Lawrenceville, N.J., that assigns codes in the United States and Canada. Second, 13-digit bar codes are used almost everywhere else in the world. The council's European counterpart, EAN International, based in Brussels, assigns these numbers, called European Article Numbers, to companies in 99 nations. ""Right now,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""foreign importers have to get a 12-digit U.P.C. to do business over here, which they haven't been too happy about."" Foreign manufacturers currently pass on to consumers the cost of getting an additional bar code and creating special labels for products sold in the United States and Canada. ""It's an added expense for them, and they have to recoup it somewhere,"" said Debra Shimkus, marketing manager at the Chicago Importing Company, a specialty food importer whose overseas suppliers are often incredulous when they are told they have to get new bar codes for their products before they can be sold in American groceries. Many foreign manufacturers decide that it is not worth the trouble. ""A lot of companies have been unwilling to accept the additional burden,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""and have stayed out of the market entirely."" American and Canadian exporters have not had the same obstacle because foreign retailers can easily incorporate a 12-digit number into their 13-digit databases by making the first digit zero. That is why American and Canadian manufacturers of products that now have 12-digit codes will not be affected by the code expansion. A two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola, for example, will keep the same U.P.C., but a zero will be added to the beginning of its bar-code number in retailers' product databases. ""The effect of the change in the U.P.C. code falls squarely on retailers,"" said Mr. Friedman. He estimates that the upgrade will cost at least $2 million for a chain of 100 stores with 10 checkout lanes a store. The expense will vary depending on the age of a retailer's databases, software and hardware and whether it has to hire outside consultants to make the change. Scanners and other hardware bought more than three years ago will not read longer codes and will have to be replaced. Software more than five years old will also have to be scrapped. ""Thank God we'd already planned to buy new equipment for a lot of stores this year,"" said Richard S. Gilbert, director of store systems at Duane Reade, a chain of 200 drugstores in New York City. The stores have a total of 3,500 scanning devices, each costing $1,000 to $2,500. As for the cumbersome database modifications that need to be made, Mr. Gilbert but they haven't gotten back to me with a plan. I still don't know how big a deal it's all going to be."" He might want to ask John Poss. Mr. Poss is the merchandising coordinator for Ace Hardware, which has 5,100 stores and sells some 65,000 coded products. Ace overhauled its computer systems to accept longer bar codes in 1999. The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., has retail outlets in 70 countries and more than a hundred foreign suppliers. ""It was such a struggle to get manufacturers to relabel things for North America,"" Mr. Poss said, ""and we wanted the same system in place globally, so we decided to make the change."" The company hired a consultant, Cognizant Technology Solutions, which is based in Teaneck, N.J., and is a division of Dun & Bradstreet. Ace's in-house team worked on the project during the day while a Cognizant office in India took over at night. Even so, the project took almost two years to plan and carry out. In addition to equipment upgrades, modifications had to be made in more than 500 software programs in various company divisions (50 in distribution alone). The most tedious and time-consuming part of the conversion, Mr. Poss said, was making adjustments to databases. ""Every database in every division touches bar code information, and they all needed to be reworked,"" he said. ""It's like Y2K, where you had to go in and expand fields and find every reference to the date."" Though Mr. Poss would not disclose the cost of the project, he said the gains in efficiency and in suppliers' good will had been ""well worth the expense."" His advice to other retailers is to ""get busy because you're facing an extreme challenge."" But moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal Code Council and EAN International, which formed an alliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and retailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to accommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly patented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced size means that it can be affixed to small items like loose produce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of additional data like batch and lot numbers. That additional information would make product recalls easier. ""Today,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""once a product is taken out of the shipping container in the warehouse, you really can't track it anymore."" Shipping container bar codes are already 14 digits. The different bar-code standards mean that retailers need different computer systems for shipping and receiving, inventory and sales. By adopting a 14-digit standard, retailers should be able to put all the information into a single database. Mr. Poss said Ace had added the capacity to scan and store 14 digits when it made its conversion three years ago. ""Now we can scan anything,"" he said, ""whether it's in the warehouse or at the register, and it immediately goes in to a centralized system. No more sending data between divisions."" The cost and work of making the transition to 14 digits, he said, was the same as it would have been for a change to 13 digits. Representatives from the standards groups said adopting a 14-digit structure - a step for which no date has been set - could help streamline the sharing of data among all parts of a retail operation. It would also make it possible, they said, to identify products anywhere in the world at any time during the trade process. ""And to think it all started with pack of gum,"" Mr. Poss said.

">Mail Me the Money! >By David Friedman 08/08/2002 David is a very bright fellow. But this time he's several years behind. The idea of using epostage to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The problem is how to get over the adoption hump. Until most people are taking one form of epostage, most people don't have enough incentive to download and install something that allows them to pay it. Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even from known senders. Giving someone my email address doesn't automatically put them in my white list. Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by removing the need to pay money for epostage. Instead, the sender burns processing time on his computer, answering a cryptographically hard challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is inadequate incentive to do so until there is a standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is born until a significant fraction of the market has taken that first step. It may take government action, to institute an effective epostage standard! I think the better idea is to require that people off your white list ""hand sign"" email to you. A couple of companies are now trying to implement this. An email sender, if not on your white list, must respond to a verification email or go to a website, by a process that is very simply for a human sender, but difficult for a spammer to automate. Where epostage requires a standard mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for ""hand signing"" would frustrate spammers while making it no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail clients incorporate this kind of feature. The advantage to putting this in the mail client is that the required ""hand sign"" can be ""Your attempt to email David Friedman is blocked until you fill in the Incredible ______ Machine."" It will be a long time before spammers have a process that defeats millions of personal challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in mind that would work a large percentage of the time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure out such hacks, people would then improve their challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another arms race, and spam would leak through to the unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps spammers identify and target the part of the population whose challenges are sub-par, which is their natural prey. People like David aren't in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley debt consolidation. Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he didn't point out that spam is the result of government. The government is ineffective at preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers. MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your",no

I note 1) It's one of those Makefile.PL things. 2) While I know that Makefiles generated by a ./configure generated in turn by a later version of auto* do support the technique you're trying, I know nothing about what the Perl MakeMaker (or whatever it is) supports. The general solution for cases like this is to install manually (Try make -n and see what it does). I think that Perl's installer system might support an installation root, though I've blissfully no idea how to operate it. I suggest finding a small Perl module SRPM and looking at the spec file to see how RedHat (or Turbo, or PLD, although RedHat generally know *all* the tricks) do it. Dave. RPM-List mailing list",no

Squid, and most other good http proxies won't let you connect to any other destination port other than 443 (by default). So the sshd has to be listening on port 443. PuTTy's proxy support is a bit flaky right now, the raw connects are a bit flaky aswell, I can't get them to work with certain revisions of IOS becuase they use different prompts and success strings, gah! I havnt played with the SOCKS proxy support much yet, but it's there. If you're trying to SSH through a http proxy, use netcat :) PuTTy's proxy stuff will take another few weeks to get stable, and currently it won't send keepalives, so if you go afk expect your session to get killed by the proxy. Netcat send keepalives which prevent this :) # # call as http_proxy_tunnel host port # function http_proxy_tunnel() { mkfifo in.fifo ( echo CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.1 echo echo HTTP/1.1 echo cat in.fifo ) | nc myproxy 3128 | (read ; read ; nc -lp > in.fifo ) } course that assumes you have bash, I use cygwin, but the above should be doable natively, then again if you have cygwin, use OpenSSH and it's excellently configurable proxycmd :) -- colmmacc@redbrick.dcu.ie -- Irish Linux Users' List",no

"Remember when I said that taking an afternoon off to march for Dmitri was pissing in the wind and that to be really effective we needed people willing to publically break the stupid laws right in the face of the authorities? Well it seems Bruce Perens agrees with me, only he's going one better, instead of just mouthing off about it, he's going to do it and do it in a big way ... Open source campaigner to risk jail By James Middleton [24-07-2002] Bruce Perens plans live DVD hack With the dust from the Elcomsoft/Sklyarov case still thick in the air, influential open source activist Bruce Perens plans to go one better by breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) during a live presentation on Friday. Fresh from giving RealNetworks a slating for not completely backing open source with its latest announcement, Perens said that during a Digital Rights Management presentation to be held Friday at the O'Reilly developer conference in San Diego, he would break the law. The DMCA has been a sore point in the open source community since the outlawing of DeCSS, a tool created so that DVDs could be played on Linux machines, and more recently since the arrest of Dmitry Sklyarov and the criminal charges faced by his employer, Elcomsoft. Based on the recent history of DMCA contravention, Perens could face imprisonment or a $500,000 fine for his actions. According to Infoworld the demonstration is to be carried out in protest at the regional system used by the motion picture industry to prevent DVDs released in one country being played on machines in another country. During his presentation, Perens will demonstrate how to hack a DVD player so that it can play movies from any region. ""It is a political and social statement, and the statement is that the people do not need to have a hall monitor living in their stereo system and should be able to play any kind of media on the device they wish,"" he was quoted as saying. But luck may be on his side, if last year is anything to go by. At the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the same slides that got Sklyarov arrested. -- Gary Lawrence Murphy TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source ""Computers are useless.

When it *is* working do a quick /sbin/lsmod and look for the module name (something like 'NVDriver'). Then put this on a new line in /etc/modules in order that linux will load it on boot. You can just do modprobe nvdriver to load it by hand. Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the driver in /lib etc. You should also get a message saying loading the nvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not open source). > Is this a problem anyone else has encountered and what is the best > solution? Can I rid myself of the tar file installations and find some > specific .deb packages? The nvidia driver source is in the Woody tree. so you can do apt-get install nvidia-kernel-src and then compile, although I've always gone the route you're doing now. Ideally the nvidia driver would be a part of the kernel from day 1. However, nvidia have not open sourced it (most of the above source is pre-compiled object code), but in order for it to work with your specific kernel you must compile against your kernel headers (as you did). As debian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package and have chosen instead to provide the source. Actually I don't know if they're permitted to distribute binaries by nvidia's license anyway. Gavin -- Irish Linux Users' List -- Irish Linux Users' List",no

"I see that Robert S. Wojciechowski Jr. posted about this issue on 7/26, but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user. The way I solved it was to run razor-admin -create and razor-admin -discover with a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe. The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a .razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist (although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to razorhome on the command line, e.g. razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discover hth, Steve -- hesketh.com/inc.

If there is a maximum trust value (if trust is some sort of percentage for instance), and if it isn't impossible to reach it, that would prevent too few people to get too much of an avantage. My guess is if 1% of razor users can reach this limit (or be near enough), spammers won't be able to cheat just by building up their trust, they would need a fair amount of fake users too. Now, for the ""fair amount of fake users"", spammers don't have access to many set of network classes. So they would need a bunch of users coming from the same set of ips. If the razor servers see 100 people on a class C network (253 ips) reporting 10000 emails a day, something wrong is going on. This could also trigger alarms. As for legitimate proxies and the like, 1) a proxy should not report any thing (spam should be reported by hand, not automatically), 2) there may be a way to have exception (IBM networks would have lots of users from the same set of ips but no likely spammers, so no alarm would trigger for their network, or better the alarm would be less sensitive). AOL could still give trouble though but even then, for one particular phone line/cable, the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class C (using network subclassing). The spammers could still try to have several connections at different locations, but that increases their cost and so is not so much interesting.

MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to have issues with Razor. Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers. In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives than false negatives. Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it. I tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like this exists, yet): red is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from several sources, and noone says ""I know this is NOT spam."" I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or archive it for humor value. I expect no false-positives to be here. yellow This may be spam. A human should decide (and report). green This is probably not spam. spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't switch, not is/maybe/isn't.

"The way Razor breaks down mail is simple. If a mail contains MIME boundaries it is split on those boundaries, each MIME part is considered when marking the mail as spam. In 2.14, there are different 'logic methods' for detecting spam. The default method 5 requires all non-contention parts to be spam for the mail to be marked as spam. A part is considered under contention if its not clear if its spam are not, and is relatively rare. Sounds like you are not using 2.14, or maybe you're misinterpreting the log files. Feel free to send me the log files if you think there is a bug. Also, as jordan says, if you get a legit mail marked as spam (based on whatever MIME stuff is going on), you should revoke it (which sends all parts in) so TeS can take care of business. cheers, chad On 19/08/02 07:41 -0700, Jordan Ritter ) If I understand you correctly, you should revoke the message en total, ) because this is one of various inputs that TeS uses to understand what ) parts are under contention. ) ) As for your question specifically, Chad can answer that (sorry, I ) don't know). ) ) --jordan ) ) On Mon, Aug 19, 2002 at 09:14:17AM -0500, Steve Price ) ) # Is there an easy way in Razor v2 to turn off detecting a message as ) # SPAM if one of the MIME parts was found in a previous SPAM?

Get a very, *very* small set of drill bits. Start drilling right through the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop off and through the board! Once you have a bit of an indent in, increase the speed a little bit. If you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use the next largest drill bit you have. Repeat until happy.

Let's limit the discussion to x86, to simplify. There are some additional complications for some of the other architectures.

OpenBSD Foundation assert a compilation copyright over the OpenBSD official ISO9660 image. A compilation copyright is the copyright monopoly that, for example, the editor of a set of third-party short stories receives. Even though he didn't write any of the constituent stories, he put creative work into selecting, arranging, and editing those stories. The law recognises such efforts as creative works deserving copyright protection, if there is sufficient creative effort. (A judge would decide, if someone made a court case of it.) Courts have held, on the other hand, that arrangement and publication of alphabetical telephone listings in a ""yellow pages"" telephone directory (the advertising section) don't have anywhere near enough creative content to support an overreaching telco's claim of compilation copyright. (The court politely said ""Nice try"", in effect.) The OpenBSD Foundation's claim may be a bit of a legal bluff, too. Theoretically, one could get around it by creating a slightly different set of ISO9660 images, thereby finessing the claim of compilation copyright. But nobody bothers, because OpenBSD Foundation actually charges only a very reasonable price for jewel-case sets, and nobody wants to endure the barrage of hatemail from Theo & co. I've never seen any claim from SuSE of compilation copyright on its ISOs or distribution as a whole. > I could be wrong, I don't use SuSE so haven't investigated, > but essentially the only 'free' version of SuSE will be it's > ftp offering. Again, the ""FTP Edition"" and the Evaluation Edition may be redistributed more-or-less freely, as long as it's not ""for value"". (Ditto the ""live-eval"" edition, which is a demo only.)

Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 (Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about (-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance made large parts of my tree reject.

"I suppose the main surprise here is that AOL is coming clean at all. After all, its long-running game of talking interop, and doing everything possible to prevent open standards in this arena, seemed to have been working fine, with most end users completely oblivious to AOL's actions. 0020723/ON20020723000833.htm America Online Scales Back Instant-Messaging Compatibility Efforts Dow Jones Newswires NEW YORK -- America Online appears to be scaling back efforts to make its instant-messaging service compatible with rival services. The unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory filing it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are more limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications Commission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001. America Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable with others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be incentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress reports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent report, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction. The upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't much closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago, according to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing instant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an America Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using third-party software such as Trillian. America Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized for blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The company also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at interoperability. For its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of its users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other companies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards. When the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America Online wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced instant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to enable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival services. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from widening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its access to Time Warner cable systems. AOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year. Specifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a technology known as ""server-to-server interoperability"" before it could offer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services to detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so via communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging provider, using a common language. But in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said it will ""focus its efforts"" on alternatives to server-to-server interoperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever. As an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to make its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service from Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will be included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release in August. IChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't involve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of messages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat customers use Apple software. ""We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short term, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide interoperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,"" Steven Teplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to the FCC. As to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan said nut to crack for the entire industry."" Indeed, users of America Online's rival services can't directly communicate with each other, either. The alternative solution ""was something that we could implement now to provide for IM communities to communicate,"" said Ms. McKiernan, adding America Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers, similar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far. FCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday. America Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday implement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the technology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus Development, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news, msgs). But America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was ""limited in scope and functionality."" True server-to-server technology ""would require further significant expenditures of time and resources to develop,"" wrote Mr. Teplitz. The Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet standards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but hasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task force representatives couldn't be reached. The company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant messaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg, analyst with Jupiter Research. ""It's still something the market wants,"" he said. ""At some point, it'll happen, but maybe a couple of years down the road."" Mr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively pursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user base. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground because prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another provider, as long as they can reach America Online users. But partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions, America Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and Yahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL has denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its system interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it. But the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are catching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base rose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's base jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of users of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million. -Peter Loftus; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5267; peter.loftus@dowjones.com Copyright 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

On the flip side of this, common law allows a breach of property law in precisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but the owner's availability to make a contract was problematic.

"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- FreeBSD-SA-02:36.nfs Security Advisory The FreeBSD Project 4.6-STABLE prior to the correction date 2002-08-01 19:31:55 UTC (RELENG_4_6) 2002-08-01 19:31:54 UTC (RELENG_4_5) 2002-08-01 19:31:54 UTC (RELENG_4_4) FreeBSD I. Background The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of its filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks. NFS is built on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. II. Problem Description A part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC messages had an error which, when the server received a message with a zero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the previous message, creating a loop in the message chain. This would later cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server code which tried to traverse the chain. III. Impact Certain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages in some cases. A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up when such clients connect. An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD system can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause the target system to lock up. IV. Workaround 1) Disable the NFS in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot. Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes should suffice. 2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from untrusted hosts. V. Solution The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 systems. a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility. # fetch # fetch b) Apply the patch. # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch c) Recompile your kernel and modules as described in < system.

"More than a dozen jokes - thanks guys and girls! (plus some anti-French abuse from the usual suspect). Well my brain doesn't hurt so much any more, and it was well worth it. I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting, both pratically and asymptotically. It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)), or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation. Before the best methods took O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it. The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes time O(n^(3+eps)). Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding some logarithmic factors. After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the number of points on the curve.

"------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~--> 4 DVDs Free +s&p Join Now A new version of unison is now available for testing. It incorporates several small improvements over 2.9.1, but the main change is a fix to a bug that had potentially serious safety consequences, but only for the very small number of users that are in the habit of running more than one instance of Unison at a time, in parallel. These users are strongly encouraged to upgrade. Others can wait if they wish. The release includes pre-built executables for Linux and Solaris, but not Windows. (We are looking for a Unison-Windows maintainer -- at the moment, none of the active developers are regularly using Unison on Windows, and we do not have a machine that is configured properly for building executables for export.) Grab it from Enjoy, -- Benjamin Changes since 2.9.1: * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number of simultaneous file transfers. * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files are stored. * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo' and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet fully working, will not be synchronized correctly.) * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g. synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for this suggestion. * Several small user interface improvements * Documentation + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web page. + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance tuning. * Makefile + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk installed + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX Changes since 2.8.1: * Changing profile works again under Windows * File movement instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by a boolean option ``xferbycopying''. * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data transferred). [ * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically linked). * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and Unix * Small + If neither the tt USERPROFILE nor the tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put its temporary commit log (called tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use tt + alternative set of values for false; default = auto. + -silent implies -contactquietly * Source + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific stuff can be made available for other projects.) + several Makefile and docs changes (for release); + further comments in ``update.ml''; + connection information is not stored in global variables anymore. Changes since 2.7.78: * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs after Unison exited). Changes since 2.7.39: * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs are now both accessible). * User manual revised. * Added some new + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh programs. + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server'' message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI). * Bug + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to change. + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode. + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI. (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes things.) + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.) * User interface and Unison + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI. + Added exit status for the textual user interface. + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or errors during update detection are now noted in the log file. + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of failing. + Made some improvements to the error messages. + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml. Changes since 2.7.7: * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system. It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight, non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This version appears stable. Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to the user interface and logging, for + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the beginning, one for the end. + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left by a previous unison run, because warning does not work nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by the user. They take the form .#..unison.tmp. * Added a new command to the GTK user Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a previous run. * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g., when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume mounted.) * Small improvements and bug + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their prefs files may now get error reports. + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name and line number. + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to the same only in identical ways since last sync.'' + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference files. + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first marshaled. + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously changing retries. + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger (force=older preference not working). * + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk 1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under Windows). + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports building dynamically linked unison executables. Changes since 2.7.4: * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup sequence. Changes since 2.7.1: * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are added to. * Bug that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an error message.) Changes since 2.6.59: * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is default. * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not mentioned in the manual any more. * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file contents. * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure that the server times out if the communication link is unexpectedly broken. * Bug + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination file. + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind a followed link. + Several other small fixes. Changes since 2.6.38: * Major Windows performance improvement! We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking for updates in large replicas. When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as 'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates, instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time, modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However, Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have overlooked an update. If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what Unison is doing. * New + This version incorporates two pieces of major new functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer internship at a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to individual files. + Centralized o Unison now maintains full backups of the last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in each replica; these function both as backups in the usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking external merge programs. o The backed up files are stored in a directory /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this directory can be changed by setting the environment variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.) o The predicate backup controls which files are actually backed causes backing up of all files. o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison updates its archive. This means that # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the archive files have been manually deleted), all files will be backed up. # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first time unison propagates an update for it. o The preference backupversions controls how many previous versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e., the last synchronized version plus one backup). o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is also still supported, but backup is now preferred. o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup directory (or to throw away the directory itself). Before unison uses any of these files for anything important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the one that it expects. + o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command, invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected). o The actual merging is performed by an external program. The preferences merge and merge2 control how this program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file (see the backup preference), then the merge preference is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In both cases, the value of the preference should be a string representing the command that should be passed to a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string, the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as follows before invoking the # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy of the file; # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary file, into which the contents of the remote copy of the file have been transferred by Unison prior to performing the merge; # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file that Unison expects to be written by the merge program when it finishes, giving the desired new contents of the file; and # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy of the original version of the file (i.e., its state at the end of the last successful run of Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not merge2). For example, on Unix systems setting the merge preference to merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for merging. A large number of external merging programs are available. For example, emacs users may find the following merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" nil ""NEW"")' merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")' (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid running off the edge of the page. In your preference file, each should be written on a single line.) o If the external program exits without leaving any file at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison considers the merge to have succeeded but to have generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke an external editor so that the user can resolve the conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs. o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give several examples in the manual. * Smaller + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf, as it did before. (This change means that included preference files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file' dialog.) + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger, but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library modules being available. + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting the propagation direction exactly backwards. + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does not exist. + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in reverse order in the user interface. * For + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective developers with navigating the code. Changes since 2.6.11: * INCOMPATIBLE * INCOMPATIBLE rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath in existing profiles should be changed to path. Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile and on the command line. You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile into default.prf = root = blah root = foo include common common.prf = Now do unison common root1 root2 when you want to specify roots explicitly. * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.) The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is also set. The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities on a one-off basis via the Actions menu. * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be relocated without changing the name of the archive file where Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for more information.) * Graphical + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from scratch. + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may have been selected for a set of changes currently being displayed will be discarded.) + Each profile may include a preference 'label = ' giving a descriptive string that described the options selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed in the top-right corner of the main Unison window. * + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to order the files backwards relative to the main user interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.) + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically fall back to the textual user interface. + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be skipped. + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements. Changes since 2.6.1: * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for directories. * Preference files may now include lines of the form include , which will cause name.prf to be read at that point. * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now works properly. * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context. * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd preference if there is one, or else just unison. * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.) * Lot of small bugs fixed. Changes since 2.5.31: * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log file seems useful for most users. * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks). Changes since 2.5.25: * INCOMPATIBLE * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed. Changes since 2.5.1: * INCOMPATIBLE synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * New + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and group-ids. These new features are controlled by a set of new preferences, all of which are currently false by default. o When the times preference is set to true, file modification times are propaged. (Because the representations of time may not have the same granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will get them as close as the operating systems involved allow.) o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership information is synchronized. o When the group preference is set to true, group information is synchronized. o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and group information is synchronized numerically. By default, owner and group numbers are converted to names on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never mapped via user/group names even if this preference is not set.) + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this preference to -1. + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else, set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want Unison to use. + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored, whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does not match any ignorenot patterns.) * User-interface + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same order as they were given on the command line or in the preferences file. + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it displays a warning window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on going. + Added a new preference for controlling how many status messages are printed during update controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1. + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem very useful, and there were too many preferences for controlling output in various ways. + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one that will be used if the user just types ) instead of all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of possibilities. + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of the archive file used to remember which files have been synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system call. However, if the environment variable UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it is a laptop and gets moved around a lot). + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is configured to synchronize them. * For + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which means we can throw away our local patched version. If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources, you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers release, available from ( challenging.) + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to contribute their programming energies. There is also a separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs. + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being maintained and no longer compiles). + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional information that should be useful for identifying sources of problems. + The version number of the remote server is now checked right away during the connection setup handshake, rather than later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that turned out to come from using inconsistent to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either client or server.) + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a link to them. * Bug + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of the replicas is on a windows machine). + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported as having changed during synchronization. This should be fixed. + Numerous smaller fixes. Changes since 2.4.1: * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This behavior can be changed in the following + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly created files to be displayed before changed files. + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing order of size. + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where is a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow' patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed first. + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed last. The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface. * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead of a synchronizer. + Giving the preference prefer with argument (by adding -prefer to the command line or prefer=) to your profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of should be propagated to the other replica (with no questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as usual. + Giving the preference force with argument will make unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root, even if it was the other replica that was changed. These options should be used with care! (More information is available in the manual.) * Small + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive). + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync compression is now enabled by default). + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which direction changes are being propagated are printed differently when the user has overridded Unison's default recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such arrows in a different color. + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility. + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual. Changes since 2.3.12: * INCOMPATIBLE synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * New/improved + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which changes are displayed to the the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default setting is false.) + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to be listed before other updates in the user interface. + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port. + Incompatible we added profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old effect is now achieved by writing + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are given but no profile is given on the command line. The new behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The manual claimed that this case would work by reading no profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true. + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always listed first + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh' command.) + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report a spurious conflict) * Improvements for the Windows + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior is described in the cross-platform section of the manual. + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares, e.g., //host/drive/path. + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml Unix.opendir fails on * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no longer being maintained): + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's default recommendation. + More colorful appearance. + The initial profile selection window works better. + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the top). + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of total bytes that have been transferred so far. * Improvements to the text user + The file details will be displayed automatically when a conflict is been detected. + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode. + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time it waits for user interaction. + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when asked whether to propagate changes. + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more questions. * Documentation and installation + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common problems and on tricks contributed by users. + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly say what are the current stable and beta-test version numbers. + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers' version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at any given time!) are now available from the download page. + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames) * Many small bug fixes and random improvements. Changes since 2.3.1: * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a 'rename' error. Changes since 2.2: * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default. (It is not stable enough yet.) * Various bug fixes. * A new experimental The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing the contents of that directory. Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the * from being interpreted by your shell. If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be used for expanding wildcard paths. ( after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command line or in the preferences file.) Changes since 2.1: * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on. * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers, showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far. * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is incremented on every significant public release and the third component is the ``patch level.'' * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface. * The manual is now available in PDF format. * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the release version of Unison. If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the end.) Changes since 1.292: * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all the files in both repositories). * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail after the client exits. * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally). Changes since 1.231: * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions. * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to you may not notice much speedup yet.) * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem, written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.) Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded clients/servers can interoperate. * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting development effort to the GTK interface from now on. * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by default). * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use unison- instead of just unison as the remote server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist conveniently on the same client, the same version will be selected on the server. Changes since 1.219: * INCOMPATIBLE synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * This version fixes several annoying bugs, + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not working. + umask is now ignored when creating directories + directories are create writable, so that a read-only directory and its contents can be propagated. + Handling of warnings generated by the server. + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both sides is now flagged as erroneous. + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant roots. o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself, which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the link is completely invisible) o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not calculate the working directory into which to write changes. This should be fixed. * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive files. * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond better. * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going back to previous items) * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be easier to find / download things now. Changes since 1.200: * INCOMPATIBLE synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows. * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the same time as the replicas are being changed by the user. * Internal performance improvements. Changes since 1.190: * INCOMPATIBLE synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the amount of memory allocation, especially during the first synchronization. This should help power users with very big replicas. * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later release. * Miscellaneous bug fixes. Changes since 1.180: * INCOMPATIBLE synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns. * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from working correctly when click-started. * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were causing spurious reports of different permissions when synchronizing between windows and unix systems. * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large replicas. Changes since 1.169: * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files. * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing functions. Some power users have reported success with very large replicas. * INCOMPATIBLE automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an appropriate ignore pattern in your profile. * INCOMPATIBLE changed. Instead of putting a line of the form ignore = in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should ignore = Regexp Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also ignore = Name matches any path in which one component matches , while ignore = Path matches exactly the path . Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in and : + a ? matches any single character except / + a * matches any sequence of characters not including / + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z } + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc. See the user manual for some examples. Changes since 1.146: * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please give it a try and let us know. * Major additions to the documentation. Changes since 1.142: * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes. * Major additions to the user manual. * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical UI from a desktop icon. * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such signal' exception. Changes since 1.139: * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade. * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything. * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such signal' exception. Changes since 1.111: * INCOMPATIBLE in the .unison directory have changed. In + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf. * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the manual for details. * You can now have different preference files in your .unison directory. If you start unison like this unison profilename (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of default.prf. * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server is left running.) * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode server has finished initalization.) * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack around with. * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make Unison better. Changes in Version 2.9.20 Changes since 2.9.1: * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number of simultaneous file transfers. * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files are stored. * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo' and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet fully working, will not be synchronized correctly.) * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g. synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for this suggestion. * Several small user interface improvements * Documentation + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web page. + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance tuning. * Makefile + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk installed + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX Changes since 2.8.1: * Changing profile works again under Windows * File movement instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by a boolean option ``xferbycopying''. * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data transferred). [ * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically linked). * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and Unix * Small + If neither the tt USERPROFILE nor the tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put its temporary commit log (called tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use tt + alternative set of values for false; default = auto. + -silent implies -contactquietly * Source + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific stuff can be made available for other projects.) + several Makefile and docs changes (for release); + further comments in ``update.ml''; + connection information is not stored in global variables anymore. Changes since 2.7.78: * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs after Unison exited). Changes since 2.7.39: * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs are now both accessible). * User manual revised. * Added some new + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh programs. + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server'' message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI). * Bug + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to change. + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode. + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI. (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes things.) + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.) * User interface and Unison + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI. + Added exit status for the textual user interface. + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or errors during update detection are now noted in the log file. + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of failing. + Made some improvements to the error messages. + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml. Changes since 2.7.7: * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system. It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight, non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This version appears stable. Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to the user interface and logging, for + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the beginning, one for the end. + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left by a previous unison run, because warning does not work nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by the user. They take the form .#..unison.tmp. * Added a new command to the GTK user Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a previous run. * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even if neither host is running Windows.

"This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. I'm sure that at the end of the universe, they'll still only find Douglas Adams, calmly munching away on his mooburger :-) The prospect of expansion so rapid that the night sky empties out because other galaxies are simply *outside* our light cone -- ??!? -- is really chilling. Puts comm latency in a whole new perspective... what if, in the future, processors go so fast there *is* no network? Or, at least, TCP segments would arrive so rarely they would seem as inscrutable as commandments from the heavens... Rohit khare@alumni.caltech.edu In the Beginning ... July 23, 2002 By DENNIS OVERBYE It has always been easy to make fun of cosmologists, confined to a dust mote lost in space, pronouncing judgment on the fate of the universe or the behavior of galaxies billions of light-years away, with only a few scraps of light as evidence. ""Cosmologists are often wrong,"" the Russian physicist Lev Landau put it, ""but never in doubt."" For most of the 20th century, cosmology seemed less a science than a religious war over, say, whether the universe had a beginning, in a fiery Big Bang billions of years ago, or whether it exists eternally in the so-called Steady State. In the last few years, however, a funny thing has happened. Cosmologists are beginning to agree with one another. Blessed with new instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope and other space-based observatories, a new generation of their giant cousins on the ground and ever-faster computer networks, cosmology is entering ""a golden age"" in which data are finally outrunning speculation. ""The rate at which we are learning and discovering new things is just extraordinary,"" said Dr. Charles Bennett, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. As a result, cosmologists are beginning to converge on what they call a ""standard model"" of the universe that is towering in its ambition. It purports to trace, at least in broad strokes, cosmic history from the millisecond after time began, when the universe was a boiling stew of energy and subatomic particles, through the formation of atoms, stars, galaxies and planets to the vast, dilute, dark future in which all of these will have died. The universe, the cosmologists say, was born 14 billion years ago in the Big Bang. Most of its material remains resides in huge clouds of invisible so-called dark matter, perhaps elementary particles left over from the primordial explosion and not yet identified. Within these invisible clouds, the glittery lights in the sky that have defined creation for generations of humans are swamped, like flecks of foam on a rolling sea. A good case can be made, scientists now agree, that the universe will go on expanding forever. In fact, recent observations have suggested that the expansion of the universe is speeding up over cosmic time, under the influence of a ""dark energy"" even more mysterious than dark matter. Recently, a group of astronomers led by Dr. William Percival at the University of Edinburgh combined data from a variety of observations to compile, based on the simplest theoretical model, what they say is the most precise enumeration yet of the parameters that cosmologists have been fighting about for all these decades. The universe, they calculated, is 13.89 billion years old, plus or minus half a billion years. Only 4.8 percent of it is made of ordinary matter. Matter of all types, known and unknown, luminous and dark, accounts for just 27.5 percent. The rest of creation, 72.5 percent, is the mysterious dark energy, they reported in a paper submitted last month to The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. It is a picture that in some ways is surprisingly simple, satisfying long-held theoretical prejudices about how the universe should be designed. Continued agreement with coming experiments may mean that science is approaching the end of a ""great program"" of cosmological tests that began in the 1930's, Dr. P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton and Dr. Bharat Ratra of Kansas State University said in the draft of a coming article for The Reviews of Modern Physics. In other ways this new dark universe is utterly baffling, a road map to new mysteries. Dr. Marc Davis, a cosmologist at the University of California at Berkeley, called it ""a universe chock full of exotics that don't make sense to anybody."" Moreover there are some questions that scientists still do not know how to ask, let alone answer, scientifically. Was there anything before the Big Bang? Is there a role for life in the cosmos? Why is there something rather than nothing at all? Will we ever know? ""We know much, but we still understand very little,"" said Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago. The Big Question Expanding Forever, Or Big Crunch? The dim caves of Lascaux, the plains of Stonehenge and the dreamtime tales of Australian aborigines all testify to the need to explain the world and existence. This quest took its present form in 1917. That was when Albert Einstein took his new general theory of relativity, which explained how matter and energy warp space-time to produce gravity, and applied it to the universe. Einstein discovered that the cosmos as his theory described it would be unstable, prone to collapse under its own gravity. Astronomers, however, were sure that the universe was stable. So Einstein added a fudge factor that he called the cosmological constant to his equations. It acted as a long-range repulsive force to counterbalance gravity. In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was expanding. The sky was full of distant galaxies all rushing away from us and one another, as if propelled by what the British astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle later called derisively a ""big bang."" The universe was not stable and, thus, did not require counterbalancing. Einstein abandoned his constant, referring to it as his biggest blunder. But it would return to haunt cosmologists, and the universe. Hoyle's term stuck, and the notion of an explosive genesis became orthodoxy in 1965, when Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr. Robert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories, discovered a faint uniform radio glow that pervaded the sky. It was, cosmologists concluded, the fading remnant of the primordial fireball itself. Relieved of their fudge factor, the equations describing Einstein's universe were simple. Dr. Allan Sandage, the Carnegie Observatories astronomer, once called cosmology ""the search for two numbers"" - one, the Hubble constant, telling how fast the universe is expanding, and the other telling how fast the expansion is slowing, and thus whether the universe will expand forever or not. The second number, known as the deceleration parameter, indicated how much the cosmos had been warped by the density of its contents. In a high-density universe, space would be curved around on itself like a ball. Such a universe would eventually stop expanding and fall back together in a big crunch that would extinguish space and time, as well as the galaxies and stars that inhabit them. A low-density universe, on the other hand, would have an opposite or ""open"" curvature like a saddle, harder to envision, and would expand forever. In between with no overall warpage at all was a ""Goldilocks"" universe with just the right density to expand forever but more and more slowly, so that after an infinite time it would coast to a stop. This was a ""flat"" universe in the cosmological parlance, and to many theorists the simplest and most mathematically beautiful solution of all. But the sky did not yield those cosmic numbers easily, even with the help of the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar Mountain in Southern California, dedicated in 1948, which had been built largely for that task. Dr. Hubble wrote of measuring shadows and searching ""among ghostly errors of measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more substantial."" The Dark Side Invisible Matter Molds Galaxies It was not till the mid-70's, a quarter-century after the Palomar giant began operating, that groups of astronomers reached the tentative conclusion that the universe they could see - stars, gas, planets and galaxies - did not have nearly enough gravitational oomph to stop the cosmic expansion. ""So the universe will continue to expand forever and galaxies will get farther and farther apart, and things will just die,"" Dr. Sandage said at the time. But the Great Argument was just beginning. Apparently there was a lot of the universe that astronomers could not see. The stars and galaxies, were moving as if immersed in the gravity of giant invisible clouds of so-called dark matter - ""missing matter"" the Swiss astronomer Dr. Fritz Zwicky labeled it in the 1930's. Many galaxies, for example, are rotating so fast that they would fly apart unless they were being reined in by the gravity of halos of dark matter, according to pioneering observations by Dr. Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and her colleagues. Her measurements indicated that these dark halos outweighed the visible galaxies themselves from 5 to 10 times. But there could be even more dark matter farther out in space, perhaps enough to stop the expansion of the universe, eventually, some theorists suggested. Luminous matter, the Darth Vaders of the sky said, is like the snow on mountaintops. But what is the dark matter? While some of it is gas or dark dim objects like stars and planets, cosmologists speculate that most of it is subatomic particles left over from the Big Bang. Many varieties of these particles are predicted by theories of high-energy physics. But their existence has not been confirmed or detected in particle accelerators. ""We theorists can invent all sorts of garbage to fill the universe,"" Dr. Sheldon Glashow, a Harvard physicist and Nobel laureate, told a gathering on dark matter in 1981. Collectively known as WIMP's, for weakly interacting massive particles, such particles would not respond to electromagnetism, the force responsible for light, and thus would be unable to radiate or reflect light. They would also be relatively slow-moving, or ""cold"" in physics jargon, and thus also go by the name of cold dark matter. As Earth in its travels passed through the dark-matter cloud that presumably envelops the Milky Way, the particles would shoot through our bodies, rarely leaving a trace, like moonlight through a window. But the collective gravity of such particles, cosmologists say, would shape the cosmos and its contents. Gathering along the fault lines laid down by random perturbations of density in the early universe, dark matter would congeal into clouds with about the mass of 100,000 Suns. The ordinary matter that was mixed in with it would cool and fall to the centers of the clouds and light up as stars. The clouds would then attract other clouds. Through a series of mergers over billions of years, smaller clouds would assemble into galaxies, and the galaxies would then assemble themselves into clusters of thousands of galaxies, and so forth. Using the Hubble and other telescopes as time machines - light travels at a finite speed, so the farther out astronomers look the farther back in time they see - cosmologists have begun to confirm that the universe did assemble itself from the ""bottom up,"" as the dark matter model predicts. Last year, two teams of astronomers reported seeing the first stars burning their way out of the cloudy aftermath of the Big Bang, when the universe was only 900 million years old. The bulk of galaxy formation occurred when the universe was a half to a quarter its present age, cosmologists say. ""The big news in the last decade is that even half a universe ago the universe looked pretty different,"" said Dr. Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena. Galaxies before then were small and irregular, with no sign of the majestic spiral spider webs that decorate the sky today. We would barely recognize our own Milky Way galaxy, if we could see it five billion years ago when the Sun formed, he said. ""By eight billion years back, it would be unrecognizable,"" said Dr. Dressler. Yet there are still many questions that the cold dark matter model does not answer. Astronomers still do not know, for example, how the first stars formed or why the models of dark matter distribution don't quite fit in the cores of some kinds of galaxies. Nor have the dark matter particles themselves been unambiguously detected or identified, despite continuing experiments. Some astronomers suggest that the discrepancies stem from the inability of simple mathematical models to deal with messy details of the real world. ""It's a huge mystery exactly how stars form,"" Dr. Richard Bond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics said. ""We can't solve it now. So it's even harder to try to solve them back then."" But others, notably Dr. Mordehai Milgrom, a theorist at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have suggested that modifying the gravitational laws by which dark matter was deduced in the first place would alleviate the need for dark matter altogether. The Bang's Fuel Inflating One Ounce To a Whole Universe Clues to what had actually exploded in the Big Bang emerged as an unexpected gift from another great scientific theory of everything that would unite all physical phenomena in a single equation. Unable to build machines powerful enough to test their most ambitious notions on Earth, some theorists turned to the sky. ""The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator,"" Dr. Jakob Zeldovich, an influential Russian cosmologist, said. Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today - gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. But they suspect, based on data from particle accelerators and high-powered theory, that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments. As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, and the laws of physics evolved, with one force after another ""freezing out,"" or splitting away. In 1979, Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, realized that a hypothesized glitch in this process would have had drastic consequences for the universe. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat in the process. Similarly, the universe could ""supercool"" and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself would become temporarily imbued with a mysterious kind of latent heat, or energy. Inserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself apart, Dr. Guth discovered in a calculation in 1979. In far less than the blink of an eye, 10-37 second, a speck much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size of a grapefruit and then resumed its more stately expansion, with all of normal cosmic history before it, resulting in today's observable universe - a patch of sky and stars 14 billion light-years across. All, by the magical-seeming logic of Einstein's equations, from about an ounce of primordial stuff. ""The universe,"" Dr. Guth liked to say, ""might be the ultimate free lunch."" Dr. Guth called his theory inflation. Inflation, as Dr. Guth pointed out, explains why the universe is expanding. Dr. Turner of the University of Chicago referred to it as ""the dynamite behind the Big Bang."" As modified and improved by Dr. Andrei Linde, now at Stanford, and by Dr. Paul Steinhardt, now at Princeton and Dr. Andreas Albrecht now at the University of California at Davis, inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology ever since. One of its great virtues, cosmologists say, is that inflation explains the origin of galaxies, the main citizens of the cosmos. The answer comes from the paradoxical-sounding quantum rules that govern subatomic affairs. On the smallest scales, according to quantum theory, nature is lumpy, emitting even energy in little bits and subject to an irreducible randomness. As a result, so-called quantum fluctuations would leave faint lumps in the early universe. These would serve as the gravitational seeds for future galaxies and other cosmic structures. As a result of such successes, cosmologists have stuck with the idea of inflation, even though, lacking the ability to test their theories at the high energies of the Big Bang, they have no precise theory about what might have actually caused it. ""Inflation is actually a class of theories,"" said Dr. Guth. In the latest version, called ""chaotic inflation,"" Dr. Linde has argued that quantum fluctuations in a myriad of theorized force fields could have done the trick. Indeed, he and others now say they believe that inflation can occur over and over, spawning an endless chain of universes out of one another, like bubbles within bubbles. ""The universe inflates on top of itself,"" Dr. Linde told a physics conference this spring in Princeton. ""It's happening right now."" The Golden Age New Devices Detect Primordial Glow If the inflationary theorists are right, the universe we see, the 14 billion light-years, is just a tiny piece of a much vaster universe, or even a whole ensemble of them, forever out of our view. According to the theory, therefore, our own little patch of the cosmos should appear geometrically ""flat,"" the way a section of a balloon looks flat when viewed close up. This was the universe long thought to be the most beautiful and simple. But it required, by the logic of Einstein's general relativity, that there be much more dark matter, or something, to the universe, enough to ""flatten"" space-time, than astronomers had found. In fact, this prescription was so hard to reconcile with other observations, of galaxies and their evolutions, that by 1991 some astronomers and press reports suggested that the entire theoretical edifice of inflation to blow up the universe and cold dark matter to fill it, not to say the Big Bang itself, might have to be junked. So it was with a sigh of relief that cosmologists greeted the announcement in April 1992 that NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE, satellite had succeeded in discerning faint blotches in the primordial cosmic radio glow. These were the seeds from which, inflation predicted, large cosmic structures would eventually grow. ""If you're religious, it's like seeing God,"" said Dr. George Smoot, a physicist from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who led the COBE team. Astronomers say COBE signaled a transition in which heroic ideas about the universe began to be replaced by heroic data, as long-planned new telescopes and other instruments went into operation. A year later, skywalking astronauts corrected the Hubble telescope's myopic vision. The cosmic background radiation has come in for particular scrutiny from new radio telescopes mounted in balloons and on mountaintops. The news has been good, though not decisive, for inflation. For three years, a series of increasingly high-resolution observations has confirmed that the pattern of blotches stippling the remnant of the primordial fireball is consistent with the predictions from inflation and cold dark matter. The instruments have now mapped details small enough to have been the seeds of modern clusters of galaxies. ""I'm completely snowed by the cosmic background radiation,"" Dr. Guth said. ""The signal was so weak it wasn't even detected until 1965, and now they're measuring fluctuations of one part in 100,000."" Perhaps most important, the analysis of the fluctuations indicates that the universe has a ""flat"" geometry, as predicted by inflation. That was a triumph. Although observations could not prove that inflation was right, a nonflat universe would have been a blow to the theory, and to cosmological orthodoxy. ""Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the earliest moments of creation, passed its first very important test,"" Dr. Turner said at the time. The most precise measurements of the cosmic background, at least in the near future, are generally expected to come late this year from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Project, or MAP, satellite, which was launched into space last year on June 30. MAP will be followed by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite, in 2006. It is highly unlikely that MAP or Planck will be able to detect what Dr. Turner calls ""the smoking gun signature of inflation."" The violent stretching of the universe should roil space-time with so-called gravitational waves that would leave a faint imprint on the cosmic fireball. Detecting those waves would not only confirm inflation, but also might help scientists establish what caused the inflation in the first place, giving science its first look at the strange physics that prevailed when creation was only about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. The Universe's Fate Bleak Implications Of `Dark Energy' In 1998, two competing teams of astronomers startled the scientific world with the news that the expansion of the universe seemed to be speeding up under the influence of a mysterious antigravity that seems embedded in space itself and that is hauntingly reminiscent of Einstein's old, presumably discredited, cosmological constant. ""Dark energy,"" the phenomenon was quickly named. If dark energy is real and the acceleration continues, the galaxies will eventually speed away from one another so quickly that they couldn't see one another. The universe would become cold and empty as the continued acceleration sucked away the energy needed for life and thought. It would be ""the worst possible universe,"" for the quality and quantity of life, said Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University. Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, called the discovery of dark energy ""the strangest experimental finding since I've been in physics."" The discovery was a surprise to the astronomers involved. Neither team had expected to find the universe accelerating. They had each set out to measure by how much the expansion of the universe was slowing because of the gravity of its contents and thus settle the question of its fate. One team was led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley. The other team was a band of astronomers led by Dr. Brian Schmidt of Mount Stromlo and the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. Each group employed far-flung networks of telescopes, including the Hubble, and the Internet to find and monitor certain exploding stars, or supernovas, as cosmic beacons. Such explosions, the death rattles of massive stars, are powerful enough to be seen clear across the universe when the universe was younger and, presumably, expanding faster. Leapfrogging each other across the universe, the two teams, propitiously for their credibility, arrived at the same answer at the same it was speeding up. Dr. Perlmutter, who had once resented the competition, conceded, ""With only one group, it would have been a lot harder to get the community to buy into such a surprising result."" ""This was a very strange result,"" said Dr. Adam Riess, a member of Dr. Schmidt's team. ""It was the opposite of what we thought we were doing."" The results have sent Einstein's old cosmological constant to the forefront of cosmology. Despite his disavowal, the constant had never really gone away and had in fact been given new life by quantum physics. Einstein had famously rejected quantum's randomness, saying God didn't play dice. But it justified, in retrospect, his fudge factor. According to the uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum theory, empty space was not empty, but rather foaming with the energy of so-called virtual particles as they flashed in and out of existence on borrowed energy. This so-called vacuum energy could repel, just like Einstein's old cosmological constant, or attract. The case for dark energy got even stronger a year later, when the cosmic background observations reported evidence of a flat universe. Because astronomers had been able to find only about a third as much matter, both dark and luminous, as was needed by Einstein's laws to create a flat geometry, something else had to be adding to it. The discovery of dark energy exemplified Dr. Zeldovich's view of the universe as the poor man's particle accelerator, and it caught the physicists flat-footed, somewhat to the pride of the astronomers. ""A coming of age of astronomy,"" Dr. Dressler called it. What is dark energy? The question now hangs over the universe. Is it really Einstein's old fudge factor returned to haunt his children? In that case, as the universe expands and the volume of space increases, astronomers say, the push because of dark energy will also increase, accelerating the galaxies away from one another faster and faster, leading to a dire dark future. Other physicists, however, have pointed out that the theories of modern physics are replete with mysterious force fields, collectively called ""quintessence,"" that might or might not exist, but that could temporarily produce negative gravity and mimic the action of a cosmological constant. In that case, all bets on the future are off. The universe could accelerate and then decelerate, or vice versa as the dark energy fields rose or fell. A third possibility is that dark energy does not exist at all, in which case not just the future, but the whole carefully constructed jigsaw puzzle of cosmology, might be in doubt. The effects of cosmic acceleration could be mimicked, astronomers say, by unusual dust in the far universe or by unsuspected changes in the characteristics of supernovas over cosmic time. As a result, more groups are joining the original two teams in the hunt for new supernovas and other ways to measure the effects of dark energy on the history of the universe. Dr. Perlmutter has proposed building a special satellite telescope, the Supernova Astronomy Project, to investigate exactly when and how abruptly the cosmic acceleration kicked in. The Nagging QuestionsA Grand Synthesis, But Hardly Complete For all the new answers being harvested, some old questions linger, and they have now been joined by new ones. A flat universe is the most mathematically appealing solution of Einstein's equations, cosmologists agree. But they are puzzled by the specific recipe, large helpings of dark matter and dark energy, that nature has chosen. Dr. Turner called it ""a preposterous universe."" But Dr. Martin Rees, a Cambridge University cosmologist, said that the discovery of a deeper principle governing the universe and, perhaps, life, may alter our view of what is fundamental. Some features of the universe that are now considered fundamental - like the exact mixture of dark matter, dark energy and regular stuff in the cosmos - may turn out to be mere accidents of evolution in one out of the many, many universes allowed by eternal inflation. ""If we had a theory, then we would know whether there were many big bangs or one,"" Dr. Rees said. The answers to these and other questions, many scientists suspect, have to await the final unification of physics, a theory that reconciles Einstein's relativity, which describes the shape of the universe, to the quantum chaos that lives inside it. Such a theory, quantum gravity, is needed to describe the first few moments of the universe, when it was so small that even space and time should become fuzzy and discontinuous. For two decades, many physicists have placed their bets for quantum gravity on string theory, which posits that elementary particles are tiny strings vibrating in a 10- or 11-dimensional space. Each kind of particle, in a sense, corresponds to a different note on the string. In principle, string theory can explain all the forces of nature. But even its adherents concede that their equations are just approximations to an unknown theory that they call M-theory, with ""M"" standing for matrix, magic, mystery or even mother, as in ""mother of all theories."" Moreover, the effects of ""stringy physics"" are only evident at energies forever beyond the limits of particle accelerators. Some string theorists have ventured into cosmology, hoping, to discover some effect that would show up in the poor man's particle accelerator, the sky. In addition to strings, the theory also includes membranes, or ""branes,"" of various dimensions. Our universe can be envisioned as such a brane floating in higher-dimensional space like a leaf in a fish tank, perhaps with other brane universes nearby. These branes could interact gravitationally or even collide, setting off the Big Bang. In one version suggested last year by four cosmologists led by Dr. Steinhardt of Princeton, another brane would repeatedly collide with our own. They pass back and forth through each other, causing our universe to undergo an eternal chain of big bangs. Such notions are probably the future for those who are paid to wonder about the universe. And the fruits of this work could yet cause cosmologists to reconsider their new consensus, warned Dr. Peebles of Princeton, who has often acted as the conscience of the cosmological community, trying to put the brakes on faddish trends. He wonders whether the situation today can be compared to another historical era, around 1900, when many people thought that physics was essentially finished and when the English physicist Lord Kelvin said that just a couple of ""clouds"" remained to be dealt with. ""A few annoying tidbits, which turned out to be relativity and quantum theory,"" the twin revolutions of 20th-century science, Dr. Peebles said. Likewise, there are a few clouds today like what he called ""the dark sector,"" which could have more complicated physics than cosmologists think. ""I'm not convinced these clouds herald revolutions as deep as relativity and quantum mechanics,"" Dr. Peebles said. ""I'm not arguing that they won't."" As for the fate of the universe, we will never have a firm answer, said Dr. Sandage, who was Hubble's protégé and has seen it all. ""It's like asking, `Does God exist?' "" he said. Predicting the future, he pointed out, requires faith that simple mathematical models really work to describe the universe. ""I don't think we really know how things work,"" he said. Although Dr. Sandage does not buy into all aspects of the emerging orthodoxy, he said it was a fantastic time to be alive. ""It's all working toward a much grander synthesis than we could have imagined 100 years ago,"" he said. ""I think this is the most exciting life I could have had.""

To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once the %files error was corrected : rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course, you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_ produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able to finish successfully. Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-) It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables during install, when the simple cases like ""%makeinstall"" or ""make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}"" don't work.

I was there. And then I went to Brussels and delivered this speech. And next I'm going here! And right after that I'm going to another, weirder event that I can't even tell you about! ------------------------------------------- Entries in the Global Civil Society Design Contest. ""What do we need for a global civil society notebook? Six design criteria are highlighted, combined with some rough sketches."" Best regards, Till Westermayer - till we *) This contest expires August 15, 2002. Speech at TTI Conference ""911.net"" by Bruce Sterling Late last month I had the joy and privilege of hanging out with a big crowd of American computer scientists who were, basically, trying to find some reasons to live. Despite all evidence to the contrary, they've definitely got some reasons. When you go to a conference which is very high-energy, with a lot of paradigmatic reassessment going on, where ideas are being flung around bodily well outside the box, well, that's an impressive thing. But it's my principle as a sometime working journalist not to get all carried away whenever I witness something like that. They might well be drinking their own bathwater. This sort of thing generally requires a reality check from some *other* conference. So, I'm now fresh back from Colorado, from the yearly meeting of the High Ground Design Conversation. These are my best pals in the industrial design world, some dear, long-time friends of mine, whose judgment I always trust. And why would a science fiction writer trust the judgment of industrial designers? Well, because they're very *trendy.* They're very shrewd, and very stylish, and very hands-on people. They're peculiarly self-effacing and modest, yet quite imaginative. Better yet, they're even practical. So they're kind of like science fiction writers, only with much better shoes. Usually when I go to this High Ground event, I just deliver some wacko chat about popular aspects of cyberculture and then I take some worshipful notes. But! I have to report that when I took them my notes from the ""CRA Grand Challenges in Computation"" conference, I was bringing the noise. This is the first time I have ever seen their jaws drop. They're still kinda wringing their hands over the dotcom boom and the Ka-boom. They miss those glory days of the World Wide Web == because for them, that was the Graphic Designers Full Employment Act. So they're pretty broke, and they're a little shell-shocked, so I guess they should join the club. But when I brought them *this* stuff == a rather extensively worked-out vision in worldbuilding from the point of view of ubiquitous computation in the 21st century... Well, of course this is merely a scenario, but to me, ""911.net"" smells like the future. And frankly, it doesn't smell good. But that's all right. Because these aren't good times. These are rather harsh, dark times, and in its own peculiar way, 911.net is a similarly harsh, dark concept. ""Ubiquitous computation"" is by no means a new idea. The guy who invented the term is dead, and even his R&D lab doesn't look all that great these days. Ubicomp has been around for quite some time == in the table-napkin, handwaving stage. But it's lacked the means, motive and opportunity to get any real-world traction. I believe that may be changing. If so, it's mostly due to the events of September 11. After that experience, ubicomp has got motive and opportunity as it never had before. And the means, although they are still speculative, are starting to make some sense. What am I talking about when I use the term ""ubicomp""? Well, the term is a grab-bag, a congelation of different technologies. Some are here, commercially available off the shelf; some are in the lab; and some may be physically impossible. Let's get down to some brass virtual tacks. What are the key technical drivers for widely distributed, self- organizing networks of sensors, processors and actuators, embedded in the physical world? And what do you do with these things? Okay, number batteries. Small, portable, dependable, long-lasting, power sources with some punch. They may not be fuel cells as they are now known. They might be MEMS fuel cells, or aluminum-air cells, or something enzymatic, I don't care; just something much, much better than today's batteries. Portable power is the crux. Ubicomp's future, if it has one, entirely hinges on this. If we don't get some seriously advanced, portable sources of power then everything I am about to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!) Number two, RFID. Radio-Frequency ID == gotta have some taggers. Gotta be on the Net. It'd be nice if they had some powered processors in them. Something internal, pervasive, a little computational action that is going on inside physical objects. Number three, wireless broadband. Getting real close here. Number four, dongles. I think this part is seriously underappreciated. This is the weird part of ubicomp, the part that may turn out to be its Achilles to turn the damn thing off. And to *know* it's off. The problem of the authorized user. The authorized administrator, the authorized access. This is likely to play out as ubicomp's functional equivalent of the Internet's intellectual-property problem. In other words, it's a very serious issue which is going to be neglected from the get-go, as people are eagerly building the basic infrastructure. Then, as they lamely try to build it in later, they are going to find out that they have inadvertently poisoned the water-stream for everybody. You don't want to wander into a Kazaa and Napster version of George Orwell. Ubiquitous computation, unlike information, does not ""want to be free."" This is not a technology of freedom. Ubiquitous computation wants to make you its slave. Try to remember that, for all our sakes, all right? This is not a water-cooler for gossip, like the Internet is. This is a hard-case, hard-times, hands-on, rather ruthless command-and-control system. Number five, GPS, global positioning systems. Been there, done that. Number six, convoy traffic. I think this is also underestimated, for when I started looking at serious applications for ubicomp, time and again, rapidly shipping large amounts of physical material in and out of the ubicomp zone is a killer application. Getting stuff in, numbering it, assembling it, moving it out. Lots of it. Train loads, truck loads, bus loads. And airlifts. Bringing up the van, a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff, of varying degrees of use and practicality. High speed fiber optic networks, check. Massive storage and routers, check. Big databases, check, but they need to be fast and flexible. Some ""MobiHoc"" assembling reconfiguring in real-time, always on the move. Facial recognition has a considerable number of ubicomp applications, by no means all of them good. Human presence-sensing systems? Oh yes. Ruggedized hardware suitable for outdoor deployment in all conditions and weathers. Real-time simulation of ongoing major situations. Toxin detectors of various kinds, environmental monitoring of almost every sort, biometric ID... I have a long list of these. I'm cross-checking them. I'm using them to build scenarios. One thing about 911.net makes it very distinct from earlier visions of ubicomp. This is not Microsoft Windows for Housekeeping. This is a hard, tough web that you throw down fast over dire emergencies. The key concept here is that we are finally moving computation out of the ivory tower, for good and all. No more glass boxes of the 1950s, no more clean abstractions of cyberspace. We are deploying computation at unheard-of speed, into the darkest, dirtiest, most dangerous places in the world. It is a resilient security apparatus for emergencies. That is 911.net. Now, you might well argue that ubicomp is very invasive of privacy. That's just what my industrial design pals said about it, immediately, and they were right. It's been hard to find reasonable deployments for ubicomp in peacetime commerce and in private homes, because it is so Orwellian. However. Under certain circumstances, other social circumstances do trump this issue. For instance, when you are breathing your last under a pile of earthquake rubble, you don't really care much about privacy under your circumstances. What you really want is a smart bulldozer, a tourniquet, and some direct pressure against your open wounds. And that is what 911.net is about == or will be about, should it find its way out of the computer-science talking-shop and into daylight. It is an emergency response system for the planet's open wounds. And those wounds exist in plenty. There are more of them all the time. I rather doubt that the Orwellian version of ubicomp has much of a future. That's a scenario that I have dubbed ""Terrorspace"", which is ubicomp in the context of airports and nuclear power sites. If you've been in airports recently, I believe you are seeing a pretty apt, early version of Terrorspace. At any random moment, you can have your possessions rifled through by strangers. Your shoes are scanned, and various small but vital objects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi- educated security geeks. They're either pathetically under-trained for the job (in which case you certainly feel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable people (in which case you pity them and wish they had some other job, for the sake of general human happiness and the GNP). Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace airports serve as political indoctrination centers that humiliate our voting population on a broad scale. They are meant to inure us to ever-escalating levels of governmental clumsiness and general harm. The difficulty with this Terrorspace approach is that airports and airlines are going broke. Airports are hemorrhaging money trying to maintain this terrorspace apparatus. It is likely to spread to the brittle power of nuclear power plants, nuclear waste dumps, bio-sites, chemical sites, liquid petroleum gas centers and so forth. That will hugely increase the overhead of all these dangerous industries. That's a very considerable tax burden. So, though Terrorspace may serve as a full employment program for the loyal and slightly stupid, that's not going to pay off socially or economically in the long run. However, 911.net is a different matter. An air- deployable 911.net that allowed first responders to rapidly deal with fires, floods and other major disasters would *save* money, especially for the insurers, who are already on the ropes. The actual September 11 event, 9/11, was a rare and remarkable thing. And, with fewer than 3,000 people dead, it's just not that big a deal as genuine catastrophes go. Politically, theologically and militarily it was huge, but a workaday 911.net wouldn't fret much about terrorism. Instead, it would have to deal mostly with floods, fires, climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes and (let's hope never) asteroids and weapons of mass destruction. So, basically, with 911.net, we are describing a social re-definition of computer geeks as firemen. Native twenty-first century computer geeks as muscular, with-it, first-responder types. I think this would be pretty good for the computer industry. We all need to take the dysfunctional physical world far more seriously. This week, Italy's flooding, Texas is flooding, Colorado's on fire. This morning, the brand-new wilderness forests around the site of the former Chernobyl are on fire, spewing radioactive ash hither and yon. Chunks of Antarctica the size of Rhode Island have fallen into the sea. I could go on. This is the sort of activity that humanity is required to deal with in this new century. If we build a successful method with which to do this, those useful tactics will spread across the fabric of our civilization. I believe they are already spreading. An innovation like 911.net will likely serve as a camel's nose in the tent for a whole series of ubicomp applications across society. I've been speculating about these new forms of ubicomp, and giving them some flashy neologisms, because that is what science fiction writers bring to the table. We build little scenario worlds and make up names for them. First we've got ""911.net,"" then ""Terrorspace,"" but there are others. BATTLESPACE. A term already much-used by the Pentagon. Battlespace means military C4ISR. The ""Revolution in Military Affairs."" I would point out that the military, unlike some sectors, is not reneging on their enthusiastic commitment to the digital revolution. On the contrary. I haven't seen anybody in the military saying that they long to go back to the good-old-fashioned, solid, easy-to- understand methods of the War in Vietnam. The military are very into ""network-centric warfare,"" and they couldn't be happier about their spysats and surveillance drones. PROSTHETIC UBICOMP. This is eldercare. A huge, steadily growing market. Alzheimer's disease is a flat-out domestic catastrophe that lasts seven years. Any computational help here == in elder-proofing spaces, tracking the sick and so forth == would be of huge benefit to society. CRADLE.NET. Babies have no privacy. Children have little privacy. Child-proofing a room against a crawling tot... if you've ever done this, you can realize how much use it might be to have this process automated. Any two-year-old always be friends?"" A real-time checklist, at the very least! And then we're faced with the interesting, large-scale prospects of ""K-12.net."" STREET.NET. This would be traffic management and urban systems management. Water networks, power networks, subways, sidewalks and so forth. PUNISH.NET. Two million people are in the American prison population. They've got no privacy. They've gotta be watched all the time. They're basically crammed in iron cages now. INDUSTRIAL UBICOMP. Managing supply chains, industrial assembly and so forth. This will eventually be the biggest application. SO/HO UBICOMP. Ubicomp in the home, the home office and small office. Some very interesting consumer uses here, but in the grand scheme of things, not that big a deal. SAFETYSPACE. These would be military bases, U.N. safety zones, refugee camps, and disaster evacuation centers. It's fairly easy to imagine ubiquitous computation as a sinister ""gated community"" that walls off privileged areas under threat. But we can also think of it as importing some human comfort, solidarity, mercy and safety into various benighted areas that are severely disturbed. One can imagine a Gorazde UN safe zone version of this, new and improved of the dead of night, deploys a scattering of small drones, smart-mines and sensors, and suddenly the war just stops within these bounds of Safetyspace. Rapine, looting, sacking, smashing and burning are ruled out of existence through computer awareness. The handiness of a technique like that for life in the 21st century... well, it might be a bit underestimated. And last, coming up with a bullet should the good times return in all their carefree take to be ubicomp as an Urban Entertainment Destination. You go there for fun just because there is cool, wacky stuff embedded in the physical world, and it's behaving in a way that brings joy and hilarity and good spirits, like the funhouse mirror at a digital carnival. When and if Ubitopia really hits, it will mean that humanity's basic relationship with our material goods has been radically redefined. That is the apotheosis of ubiquitous computation. we deal with them, are different. Different in character, different in quality. Not recognizable by 20th century standards. So. I have no idea if the Homeland Security department, or FEMA or DARPA or the NSF, are going to pony up any money for any of these notions. That's not my lookout. I'm a science fiction writer.

"FYI, members of this list might be interested in the 4th International Workshop on Web Site Evolution (WSE 2002), being held October 2, 2002, in Montreal, Canada. - Jim >>From the Web The potential of the Web as a vehicle for offering a variety of services is becoming more apparent as Web sites evolve their contents from static information to more dynamic and interactive forms. A number of new standards and commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web. The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web design, software engineering, and information technology communities to discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse. Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and experience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the Web. WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not limited to): * Migrating to Web services * Web quality determination and improvement through process and product control * Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable * Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure * Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple platforms * Applying traditional software engineering activities such as architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites * Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution WSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event focused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of ""maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems"" nicely compliments WSE 2002's overall theme and goals.",no

It's still quite easy to find out, pre-purchase, what components if any are going to give you problems with a specific distribution/version. With Dell just check the support.dell.com site, match the system, look for downloadable drivers. From these if there aren't any linux drivers you can usually find out the chipset of each device. Plug them into google with ""linux"" and see what people have to say about them. Generally speaking when you buy the system you'll be told the make/model of each device rather than the chipset, so further investigation is necessary. The cavaet, of course, is always to know exactly what you're buying.

The ADR (Advanced Digital Recording) tape format is an interesting option, one I hadn't seen much of, before. Look as if OnStream (spun off from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly control the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make compatible media under licence. If you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn (and well before they start failing). That requires at least a couple of dozen tapes for the first couple of years. Therefore, cost and availability of media are (or should be) a major factor. Also, tape heads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan systems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always ends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy competition. The less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is that, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement that would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another OnStream ADR drive. In that sense, you're somewhat locked not seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed them). If OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into the system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they get people to buy in. I see the following prices for mail order ( 42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape 33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack. 66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape. 44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack. 47 euros for ADR cleaning tape. (You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.) Capacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression ratio. The PDF datasheet for Onstream's ""ADR2"" series says this is a linear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT, and LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and 8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads). I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite Technology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives. My recollection is that BRU will do it. On balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3 or DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one oddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the experience. But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed, and might be a good bet after all.

"Thanks that helps. There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works. I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100"" which I thought would be zero. So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up. Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level. Now here come the questions... What engine signature does TES look at? Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures. How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases? How many revokes decreases someones rating? Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message? If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up? In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- Bobby, Couple of If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting. Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user). apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate. cheers, vipul.

""Though summers are hard in any city, Tokyo's narrow streets, hordes of people and clusters of massive skyscrapers, largely unrelieved by greenery, produce a special brand of discomfort. ""And it gets worse every year. (((Oh yeah. You bet it does.))) The number of nights when temperatures stay above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) in Tokyo has doubled over the last 30 years, while average temperatures have shot up by 2.9 degrees C over the last century. Relief, however distant, could be on the way. (((""Great news, weather sufferers! We live in the high-tech capital of a G-7 state!""))) ""At the behest of the Construction Ministry, the panel has drawn up a plan that would use a network of buried pipes, and water pumped from the sea, to cool things down. 'In the very best conditions, certain areas could in theory become as much as 2.6 degrees Celsius cooler,' said Yujin Minobe, a ministry planner. ""The huge air-conditioning systems currently used to cool buildings get rid of the heat they take out of the structure by venting it into the outside air, raising temperatures still further and creating a 'heat island' phenomenon in large cities. (((Soon whole *cities* will do it and vent their heat straight into the rising seas! Look out, Antarctica.))) ""Under the plan, this heat would be transferred to water in large underground tanks, and the water then pumped through a six-km (3.7-mile) network of underground pipes to a cooling plant on the Tokyo waterfront. ""There the heat from this water would be transferred to cooler sea water before the then-cooled water was pumped back through the underground pipes. The sea water, now warmed, would be released into the waters of Tokyo Bay. ""COSTLY PLAN. (((That's unsurprising.))) Minobe said the plan would cover some 123 hectares (304 acres) in the centre of Tokyo, including the Marunouchi business district and the posh Ginza shopping area, and would initially cost around 41 billion yen ($344 million). ""'Savings on reduced energy usage would eventually help pay for this,' he said. (((A real nest of ironies here, folks.))) Officials quoted in the English-language Japan Times said energy savings would total more than 1 billion yen a year, meaning the system would pay for itself in a bit over 30 years. ""However, Minobe said many problems remained with the plan, which has only been under discussion since April last year. One of the most serious problems is whether warmer water being returned to Tokyo Bay would damage the fragile marine ecosystem, a point Minobe said still required more study. (((Give it 30 years and there won't be any ecosystem left to study.))) ""He said the average temperature cut is likely to be only around 0.4 degrees. 'I'm not even sure people would be able to feel that difference,' he said. Any such plan, however, would likely produce a gleam in the eyes of Japan's huge construction industry, known for its propensity for public works projects. Although several are decried as wasteful, public works projects have long been used by the government in attempts to stimulate the economy. (((Nice use of the word ""attempts.""))) ""Frankly, I think this plan is still really more of a dream than anything else,"" Minobe said.

It's not hard math - jpeg is a straight block-based DCT with quantisation - which is about the oldest image compression algorithm out there, and I think certainly predates 1986. So I really have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT on 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients, or DCT in general?

Anyway, here's to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in court.

If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds? As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to be a lot of documentation around about it. Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP. Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card modules on the cdrom.

Friday, 16 August, 2002, 11:42 GMT 12:42 UK FBI warns about wireless craze Some FBI agents are worried about warchalking Well-meaning wireless activists have caught the attention of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. One of its agents has issued a warning about the popular practice of using chalk marks to show the location of wireless networks. The marks, or ""warchalks"", are cropping up in cities and suburbs across the world. The FBI is now telling companies that, if they see the chalk marks outside their offices, they should check the security of wireless networks and ensure they remain closed to outsiders. Top marks The warchalking phenomena is only a couple of months old but it has generated a huge amount of interest. The idea behind warchalking is to use a standardised set of symbols to mark the existence of wireless networks that anyone can use to go online. Many community groups and local governments, and even some public-spirited companies, are setting up wireless nodes that give people fast net access. This symbol denotes a closed wireless node The wireless networks replace computer cables with radio and are usually very easy to set up and connect to. Before now many curious hackers have gone on ""wardriving"" expeditions which involve them driving around an area logging the location of the wireless networks. Many companies using wireless do not do enough to make them secure and stop people outside the organisation using them. So the FBI is issuing advice to companies to be on the lookout for warchalk marks as a pointer to the security of their wireless network. ""If you notice these symbols at your place of business, it is likely your network has been identified publicly,"" warns the guidance from the FBI. Scare stories? The agent who circulated the warning in Pittsburgh said it was not an official FBI advisory or policy but was information worth passing on. He urged anyone using a wireless network to ensure that it was secure and used only by those a company wants to access it. Warchalkers have questioned the scare stories surrounding the phenomena, saying that anyone with malicious intent is unlikely to publicly mark their target. The phrases ""wardriving"" and ""warchalking"" derive from the early days of computer hacking when curious users programmed their computers to search for all phone lines that returned data tones. The exhaustive searching was known as ""wardialling"".",no

Bullshit meter red-lining again... You aren't the first person to ask this question, but over the last few years there have been some good answers to this coming from the genetics research folks. As I understand it, there is a growing body of genetic evidence that European immune systems are substantially tougher and more resistant to a wider range of infectious diseases than those found in other peoples around the world, including a surprisingly wide range of hereditary immunities and partial immunities/resistance to common viruses and bacteria found around the world. As a result, when the first wholesale mixing of people from different parts of the world started occurring on a regular basis, the Europeans fared much better than most others. The standard theory for this is that Europe was the first major region of the planet to become densely populated and urbanized (to the extent that they ""urbanized"" a thousand years ago). Because of this, Europe was a festering cauldron of disease without the benefit of modern sanitation and medicine for a thousand plus years, much more so than the rest of the world and suffered from repeated large-scale epidemics and plagues that took severe tolls on the population. Modern ethnic Europeans have genetics that survived a unique and brutal culling process by a rather extensive range of diseases over dozens of generations. What the geneticists are discovering is that for a great many of the world's most common infectious diseases, there is a percentage of the ethnically European population that has hereditary immunity and an even larger segment that has at least some hereditary resistance compared to people from other parts of the world. And for most ethnic Europeans it isn't just one disease, they have varying levels of genetic resistance to a veritable cornucopia of infectious diseases. Because of similarities in the mechanisms and characteristics of viruses and other pathogens around the world to ones that Europeans were exposed to, the robust defenses their genetics provided them against their native diseases frequently imparted some resistance to diseases which they had never been exposed.

"Two interesting analyses of the Irish implementation of copyright as led by, as best I can tell, anticipation of the EUCD (since the Irish law was passed in 2000, and the EUCD is somewhat more recent than that). The pieces of interest are the papers by Prof. Robert Clark, who perhaps might not be a bad choice of speaker for some future LUG gathering. One of the more eye-opening comments in the second of his papers is that Irish legislation is, in effect, more draconian than the DMCA.

"Posted on Thu, Jul. 25, 2002 Copyright Law Thwarts Open Source Confab Demo Posted by Dan Gillmor Bruce Perens was going to demonstrate a modified DVD player at this week's Open Source gathering in San Diego. He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a DVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with different regional codes. Perens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological methods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want. And the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to ask him not to do the demonstration. HP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was willing to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried that it would be ""a more juicy target,"" the kind of deep pockets that might make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's understandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would take a stand on the right side of this issue. So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on things like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A shame, but that's how things are going these days.

"I rigged this up for testing before I commit to a sitewide rollout of Spamassassin as an SMTP relay. It is more work, but it avoids sitewide changes in mail delivery during the early stages of testing. On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com) Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address. Create a ""custom recipient"" with the old SMTP address (spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com). Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom recipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory) On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com) Set up a dummy user, in this case ""killspam"" Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private smtp address back on the Exchange server. So the message flow is like Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for spammedalot@yourdomain.com spammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com Following the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to nomorespam@yourdomain.com Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second one I protected was postmaster. As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address you want to protect.

The following is the company's 1) HP is committed to protecting our customer's security environments. 2) We have verified that there is a security vulnerability with Tru64 UNIX, the details of which were brought to our attention July 18.

I think you need to understand that simplifying the configuration options and the UI does make it a lot easier to use for people who are either not using it all the time or are just starting to use it.

"Release Notes for libpng libpng is a library used to create and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image files. The 1.2.4* and 1.0.14 releases of libpng solve a potential buffer overflow vulnerability[1] in some functions related to progressive image loading. Programs such as mozilla and various others use these functions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary code or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image. These new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory leaks in reading image functions. Since most applications which display images use libpng, this affects many applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red Carpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately. Ximian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris packages available. When distribution vendors update their packages, they will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade libpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2. You can also get packages from the Ximian FTP Solaris 7/8 updates maillist - updates@ximian.com Please DO NOT reply to this list! Use bugs@helixcode.com or hello@helixcode.com instead.",no

"e-matters GmbH www.e-matters.de -= Security Advisory =- Release Last could allow remote compromise of the web server. Vendor We have discovered a serious vulnerability within the default version of PHP. Depending on the processor architecture it may be possible for a remote attacker to either crash or compromise the web server. PHP 4.2.0 introduced a completely rewritten multipart/form-data POST handler. While I was working on the code in my role as PHP developer i found a bug within the way the mime headers are processed. A malformed POST request can trigger an error condition, that is not correctly handled. Due to this bug it could happen that an uninit- ialised struct gets appended to the linked list of mime headers. When the lists gets cleaned or destroyed PHP tries to free the pointers that are expected in the struct. Because of the lack of initialisation those pointers contain stuff that was left on the stack by previous function calls. On the IA32 architecture (aka. x86) it is not possible to control what will end up in the uninitialised struct because of the stack layout. All possible code paths leave illegal addresses within the struct and PHP will crash when it tries to free them. Unfortunately the situation is absolutely different if you look on a solaris sparc installation. Here it is possible for an attacker to free chunks of memory that are full under his control. This is most probably the case for several more non IA32 architectures. Please note that exploitability is not only limited to systems that are running malloc()/free() implementations that are known to be vulnerable to control structure overwrites. This is because the internal PHP memory managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses. Proof of e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to the public. Vendor 22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this vulnerability was released and can be downloaded The vendor announcement is available If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible, especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all kinds of POST requests on your server. pub 1024D/75E7AAD6 2002-02-26 e-matters GmbH - Securityteam Key fingerprint = 43DD 843C FAB9 832A E5AB CAEB 81F2 8110 75E7 AAD6 Copyright 2002 Stefan Esser.

I don't think I could argue that ZODB is more reliable that BerkeleyDB. It's true that we have fewer database experts and expend fewer resources working on database reliability. On the other hand, Barry is nearly finished with a BerkeleyDB-based storage for ZODB. ZODB is an object persistence tool that uses a database behind it.

My ISP does offer backups at extra cost but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.

This is designed for use when reporting on the life of Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly missed. The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset about the death of a complete stranger. Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new tag.

The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the effect on the reader could be In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme, Stephen Byers touched the lives of billions.

However, Windows expects the time in the RTC to be local time. Linux can be configured to do either this, or to have the RTC at UTC, and then use /etc/localtime to figure out the right timezone.

The shuttles drove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then later brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air. Many days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles and drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong. Hernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came to him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were not yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in Cafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you thought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the floor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they ate at you. When Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. ""The RAID is huge with bugs,"" Hernando said. ""The bugs are infinite."" ""Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs."" ""Once you were great with the bugs,"" Hernando said. ""No one was greater,"" he said again. ""Even Prado."" ""Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs."" Hernando shrugged. ""Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in Chicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers."" ""Herb tea?"" ""It is true, my friend."" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his office and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels. Michaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for awhile, then he asked Michaels, ""I need you to triage for me."" Michaels looked down. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said. ""This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs."" ""I'm finished with that,"" Michaels said again. ""I just want to live quietly."" ""Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only drink herb tea."" ""Herb tea?"" Michaels said. ""It is true,"" he said sorrowfully. Michaels stood up. ""Then I will do it, my friend,"" he said formally. ""I will do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for the time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time Prado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them with no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all the pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank."" Together they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good.

"""This is a very tenuous time for Microsoft,"" Gartenberg said. ""This is not a time in Microsoft's history when it can be seen as trying to do to Real what it did to Netscape."" Rrrrrrriiiiiight.... July 22, 2002 RealNetworks Poses Challenge to Microsoft By JOHN MARKOFF SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 -- In a significant challenge to Microsoft, RealNetworks plans to announce a new version of its software on Monday that can distribute audio and video in a range of formats, including Microsoft's own proprietary Windows Media. The new software is intended for large media companies and other corporations that need to send audio and video data to customers and employees in a variety of different formats. But RealNetworks acknowledged that it was possible that the company might incur Microsoft's legal wrath. Nevertheless, Rob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive who founded RealNetworks as Progressive Networks in 1994, said he believed the strategy was good for both Microsoft and consumers. ""A rational way for them to respond would be to say, `This is great,' "" he said. ""That would be Microsoft of the future."" Mr. Glaser said his company, based in Seattle, had developed a version of the Microsoft Media Server software that comes with the Windows operating system. He said RealNetworks' engineers had studied the data that was sent between the Microsoft media server software and the Windows Media Player program and recreated the technology needed to play files in the Microsoft format. This method created a so-called clean-room version, meaning the developers built the transmission software without any knowledge about the underlying program. Microsoft has adopted a similar strategy at several junctures, Mr. Glaser said, reverse-engineering technologies like NetWare, PostScript and JavaScript at different times. Microsoft executives said the company currently licensed the Windows Media Player technology to a variety of companies including Yahoo, RealNetworks and the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner. But a Microsoft executive said that a clean-room copy of the Windows server technology could lead to quality and performance issues. ""It's kind of hard to speculate about the technology until we see it,"" said Dave Fester, the general manager of the Windows Media division. If a company has not licensed the server software, he added, ""we would need to look at it and see what they're doing."" RealNetworks appears to be endeavoring to avoid being ""Netscaped,"" a reference to the fate that befell the Netscape Communications Corporation when Microsoft decided to make an Internet browser, which was pioneered commercially by Netscape, a standard part of the Windows operating system. Netscape was later acquired by AOL Time Warner. Microsoft's decision to build an Internet browser into Windows and give it away at no additional cost led directly to a bitter antitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department in 1997. RealNetworks, which was a pioneer in the market for streaming media to desktop personal computers, has been under growing pressure from Microsoft, which is giving away both the server and Windows Media Player program as part of its operating strategy. RealNetworks also faces challenges from Apple Computer, which offers the QuickTime media player as a part of its Macintosh OS X operating system and sells a more full-featured player. Moreover, in recent months Macromedia Inc., which makes the Flash animation software used on many Web sites, has added video capabilities to its technology, making it a potential rival. RealNetworks is gambling that with a proliferation of different standards and formats for video and audio, the media corporations that make content available over the Internet will flock to a single system that supports multiple types of data. The company is trying to shift the focus of the competition from the PC desktop to the server, according to analysts. Several analysts said the RealNetworks shift in strategy could put Microsoft on the defensive. ""Real has got the experience and sophistication to pull this off,"" said Richard Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a market research and consulting firm based in Seaford, N.Y. ""It will open up a new horse race."" Until now the companies have been engaged in a technology war to rapidly increase the power and quality of each of their media players. At the same time, they have competed over which of the programs are placed on the desktops of personal computer users. RealNetworks claims to have 700,000 subscribers for pay services, but it is perceived as being increasingly vulnerable, according to some analysts, because Microsoft has included its Media Player as part of the Windows operating system, which dominates the PC market. There are dozens of data formats for playing audio and video on the Internet, but the dominant ones are RealAudio and RealVideo from RealNetworks, QuickTime from Apple, Windows Media from Microsoft and the industry digital movie standards MPEG-2 and MPEG-4. Microsoft and RealNetworks are currently locked in a close race for desktop media player leadership. In the first quarter of this year, according to survey data collected by Jupiter Research, a market research firm based in New York, RealNetworks' RealOne Player had a 29.1 percent share of media players, while Microsoft's Windows Media Player had a 28.2 percent share. Apple's Quicktime player was third, with a 12.2 percent. The new server software from RealNetworks is part of a version of the company's media server that is to be introduced on Monday and which will be called the Helix Universal Server. RealNetworks said it would offer performance data based on a test it financed at an independent testing service, KeyLabs, that indicate that the Helix software can, under some conditions, deliver up to four times the speed of the Windows Media Server in Microsoft's operating system. (Software servers are programs that run on powerful computers and can send streams of digital information to many computer users simultaneously.) At a news conference scheduled to be held in San Francisco, RealNetworks is also expected to announce that it plans to make the Helix software available as part of a strategy known as community source, which will make it possible for RealNetworks partners and competitors to take advantage of the original programmers' instructions. RealNetworks is to announce a range of partners, including Hitachi, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Deutsche Telekom, NEC, Nokia, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Palm, Texas Instruments and others. These partners could then incorporate the software into their own hardware and software products. Under the licensing strategy, companies will be able to freely gain access to the underlying code that the Helix program is based on, but they will still pay a licensing fee when they sell commercial products based on the technology. The community-source approach to software, which was pioneered by Sun to distribute its Java programming language, is a variation upon the original free software or open-source approach which has confounded the software industry in recent years. While open-source software can be freely shared, with some restrictions, the community-source approach is more restrictive and yet still tries to persuade others to collaborate and add innovative ideas. Other large technology companies including Sun, I.B.M. and Apple, have all now adopted variations on such open-source strategy, with varying results. In Sun's case, the company has been criticized because, while Java has become an industry standard, the company has not been the principal financial beneficiary in many cases. RealNetworks is trying to strike a balance between opening up its technology to persuade others to participate and innovate and not losing control of the technology entirely, Mr. Glaser said. ""We think we've struck the balance well,"" he said. Analysts said the strategy shift by RealNetworks was likely to shake up the industry. ""The moment you've open-sourced something you've cornered your competitor,"" said Matthew Berk, an analyst a Jupiter Research. ""To date this stuff has been very proprietary. Opening it up makes it accessible to creative and gifted programmers who will come up with wild stuff that the companies have never considered."" Mr. Glaser said he expected other companies to produce technology that would rival RealNetworks' commercially as a result of the community-source strategy. One possibility is that companies such as Sun or I.B.M. could decide to add the Helix technology of RealNetworks as a standard component of their operating systems. Although RealNetworks might not get a significant financial benefit from such an arrangement it could contribute to making its Helix software a de facto industry standard. Mr. Glaser said he had struck upon the idea of making his media server software open source while visiting with an executive from Nokia, the world's largest cellphone maker. ""Taking all of this stuff beyond the PC has been a huge motivation for us,"" he said. When he realized that Nokia was interested in deploying the software technology on as many as 30 to 40 different types of phones, he realized that RealNetworks did not have enough programming talent to support the effort. ""I told him, `I don't think we have enough engineers even if you guys were willing to pay us,' "" he said. That touched off a search for an alternative way of having the two companies cooperate. Real takes the open-source route By Jim Hu Staff Writer, CNET News.com July 22, 2002, 1:55 PM PT RealNetworks on Monday unveiled a new open-source version of its streaming media technology that supports multiple file formats for audio and video, including those that use Microsoft's Windows Media technology. The new campaign, dubbed ""Helix,"" and first reported by The New York Times, marks one of the most ambitious moves in the company's history. RealNetworks is simultaneously releasing technology without permission that plugs in to Microsoft's competing software and is raising the hood on much of its own software technology to ""open source"" developers or anyone else who wants to look. The twin moves raise the risk of lawsuits and renewed competition -- potentially even from Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft itself, once it gets a look under the hood at RealNetworks' technology. But it marks a dramatic, potential way for a company watching its market share diminish to regain momentum and support across an industry where many other players remain skeptical of Microsoft's power. ""It's a very bold move on the part of Real,"" said Michael Gartenberg, a research director for analyst firm Jupiter Research. ""This was a shot fired by Real and fired directly at Redmond."" The move is the latest in a series of strategic twists and turns that has made RealNetworks one of the only companies to survive direct Microsoft competition for years. While the company has expanded into paid subscription content business, its software and streaming media infrastructures have been under increasing pressure from Microsoft, which has deemed multimedia to be one of the major drives under the latest versions of its Windows operating system. Real's Helix announcement mainly involves the technology that allows media files to move from place to place over the Internet. RealNetworks and Microsoft both produce servers that allow video and audio to be streamed from a content company such as CNN or NBC to a personal computer. Real has charged for this software, while Microsoft has given it away for free. In April, RealMedia reached 17 million at-home viewers, compared with Windows Media at 15.1 million and Apple Computer's QuickTime at 7.3 million, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. At work, Windows Media drew about 12.2 million unique viewers, compared with RealMedia's 11.6 million and QuickTime's 5 million. Real's own new product, called the Universal Server, will allow one server to stream Real's technology, Microsoft files, Apple Computer's QuickTime, and others. Most other competing products do not support competitors' technology. ""When you have all these different platforms, and all these different protocols, it gets unmanageable,"" RealNetworks' Rob Glaser said at a high-glitz press conference in San Francisco announcing the product. ""A lot of what (this technology) is about is breaking those bottlenecks and making convergence really converge."" To make the new product compatible with Microsoft files, however, the company pursued a risky strategy known as ""reverse engineering,"" in which developers examine a competitor's product to see how it works and try to create something that works just like it. Glaser said that engineers worked entirely in a ""clean room"" environment, meaning that they had no access to actual Microsoft code. Had they simply copied code, they could be liable for patent infringement. The resulting product simply mimics the way that Microsoft's files are sent across networks and allows a Windows Media player to receive the file. Other companies have been sued for simply copying a competitor's code and putting it in their own products. But RealNetworks says it's not worried about Microsoft lawsuits, because it took precautions to do all development in the ""clean room"" environment. Microsoft itself has engaged in this kind of legal reverse engineering. Analysts say Microsoft, which still faces antitrust lawsuits, is in no position to sue in any case. ""This is a very tenuous time for Microsoft,"" Gartenberg said. ""This is not a time in Microsoft's history when it can be seen as trying to do to Real what it did to Netscape."" The influential giant? Certainly, Monday's announcement acknowledges Microsoft's influence in media technology, something Glaser and Real have often been loathe to do. Microsoft was quick to spin Monday's announcement as further validation of its strength in the marketplace. ""It's an admission of RealNetworks that it's important for them to support Windows Media and that we're now the leading player among home and work users,"" said Michael Aldridge, lead product manager for Microsoft's Windows Digital Media division. Aldridge added that RealNetworks currently has a licensing agreement for its media player to support Windows audio and video formats. However, RealNetworks and Microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server to deliver Windows Media formats to end users, which is what RealNetworks trying to do. Aldridge declined to comment on RealNetworks' replication of Microsoft's technology. In addition to its own new product, Real has promised to give away source code to much of the underlying technology for streaming media. That stops short of the actual file format, or ""codec"" itself, but will provide the open-source community and other companies with powerful new tools to build their own streaming media players or software. Glaser said he wouldn't initially make the software code that mimics Microsoft's streaming available but that he was considering the idea. A first chunk of code underlying the RealNetworks multimedia player software will be released in 90 days. Other code, including the basic functions of its streaming media server and encoder, will be released by the end of the year, the company said. The company's plan to reveal its source code--the basic instructions underlying the software--echoes similar moves made by Netscape Communications to defend against Microsoft. In March 1998, Netscape took the bold step of opening its source code to allow software developers to help create the next generation of its popular browser. James Barksdale, then CEO of Netscape, said the move would allow the company to ""tap into a virtually unlimited developer talent pool."" Instead, the effort, which has evolved into the Mozilla.org project, hit considerable roadblocks, and Microsoft overtook Netscape in market share. ---- aDaM@XeNT.CoM -- .sig double play!

It deliberately attempts to suck, mostly because it is deliberately trying to supplant CGI-like applications rather than Web-like applications. It is simply a waste of time for folks to say that ""HTTP allows this because I've seen it used by this common CGI script."" If we thought that sucky CGI scripts were the basis for good Web architectures, then we wouldn't have needed a Gateway Interface to implement them. In order for SOAP-ng to succeed as a Web protocol, it needs to start behaving like it is part of the Web. That means, among other things, that it should stop trying to encapsulate all sorts of actions under an object-specific interface. It needs to limit its object-specific behavior to those situations in which object-specific behavior is actually desirable. If it does not do so, then it is not using URI as the basis for resource identification, and therefore it is no more part of the Web than SMTP. -- Roy Fielding,",no

"What is MIME? MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"". It is the standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the world-wide Internet email system. Typical uses of MIME include sending images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file. MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message? Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use which do not understand MIME messages. However, there are a growing number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in. (One popular MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z) In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation capability in their Internet gateway products. However, even if you do not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is still hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME message. One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"". It was developed at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/. There are versions available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems. For compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE? Yes. UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems. MIME uses a more robust encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME? The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, o US East Coast o US West Coast o Pacific Rim o Europe Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt Another source of information is the Internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"", which includes a periodic posting of a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" list.",no

Each album in it's own wav file, 25 Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it doesn't crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise! xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does not have any position control so you just have to listen to the album from start to finish. file has this to say about johngay@ beatles/SGT. stereo 22050 Hz johngay@ -r-xr-xr-x 1 johngay johngay 53334900 Sep 27 2001 beatles/SGT.WAV And this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in stereo. What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV plugin, but it does not recognise these either. Any help will be greatly appreciated! Cheers, John Gay -- Irish Linux Users' List",no

The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'. 2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'. It is saying the rpm will try to support users who ""forgot"" to _leave off_ the leading '%'. That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow the documentation. If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4. Confused? Anyway, back to my original the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'? Here's some of what I found ""documented"" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' Line 46: - macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config only. Line 49: - bail on %files macro. Hmm. So, there is no %files macro? Line 172-174: - add ""rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)"" to track %post -p ""/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib"" incompatibilities. I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it appears to work just the same. The important things to remember 1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string.

"My only joke, thanks to a professor at the University of Manitoba, circa 1997. Set in the old west.

Next person A produces photo ID for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then person B can check off that person on their list. The reverse is then done for person B. After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked names.

The question is how much extra work, both up front, and then on an ongoing basis. I know nothing about how the trust system is working (still waiting for that long-promised server code to be published), but now that it's been turned on, and the more info that's coming out about it, the more concerned I'm becoming that it's extremely easy to game; that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent is low, and that once it's set up, it can be ""fire and forget"" in terms of continuing to operate in a way that's not easy to distinguish from real user behavior. > Sure, you can find a way to work almost any system, but few > users (spammers) > will actually take the time to game the system. Another concern I have with the way the system might be working is that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to utterly undermine the whole system. There are a certain number of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive to liars, or misclassifiers of ""gray"" mail, or both. It's not clear yet whether this universe is one of those or not. > That means that we might have a system that is less than 100% > effective, but > perfect accuracy and effectiveness comes at a prohibitive cost. > (Complex > systems, time numbing hours of coding etc.) You do need a certain level of accuracy though, or the filter is not economically worthwhile. If you only filter 75% of spam, you're wasting your time. Some people receive on the order of a 10:1 ratio of 5:2 which is still shitty. 95% makes it 1:2, which is better. 99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice. As the global ratio of With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming ratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK. 75% effective is now really, really shitty. > I can't vouch for Razor currently, as I'm not at all > knowledgeable.

SA definitely has a non-zero FP rate, and always will have. I would argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, including the ""no filter"" filter -- humans make mistakes too sometimes! As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I'm fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate. If spammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust system, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to replace the trust system with something else. > Perhaps Craig is just theorizing, but I just thought I'd offer my two > ity-bits.

It has great promise, and I'm hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it'll add another powerful tool in the war on spam -- I'm just concerned that it's getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to recover.

"""SpamAssassin Killed My Independence Day Party"" With all the spam that gets through, I had no idea a filter was in effect at the FoRK listserv. Turn it off! It not only risks silent false positives, but suffers them in such a way that individuals cannot adjust/detect/remedy them. Also, anti-spam startups need end-users. Centralized spam fighting takes food out of those coders' mouths! I still think self-add whitelists are underrated. A FoRK whitelist would presumably start with all subscribers, and grow from there.

"--- begin forwarded text --- begin forwarded text There is a framework for using a hashcash like proof of work function as a way to frustrate junk mailers in this ""Curbing Junk E-Mail via Secure Classification"" by E. Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bell in FC98. Online copy (Look in the view or download section at the top right, it's availabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats). The framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the current camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white list. They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical to the LWPA concept) to implement the white list. The resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in recent message Their idea of including the postage free-token in the email address, mirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother migration for non-users. eg. you can use varied sender addresses and it will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else and it will still work etc. They have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for installing some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- ""gatekeeper"" they call it.

"On 09/08/02 20:49 -0400, Sven ) In tweaking my system to try to optimize the use of razor (this now from a network/connection/etc standpoint, not so much from a philosphical stance on what is or is not considered spam and who should decide it) I have come across a couple issues that I hope I may be able to get some relief on ... ) ) 1) What *exactly* does ""Unable to connect to honor.cloudmark. It's a network error - That string is not created by Razor Agents. Its trying to connect and having trouble. 1700 times seems abnormally high. How many successful connections were there in the same timespan? ) 2) Related somewhat to question 1: is there (or will there be if currently not) a way of adjusting the timeout the setting for the razor-check to await a response from the server it queries? I am running this as a sendmail milter and adjusting the milter timeouts won't help if the razor-check script times out first anyway .... The timeout is hardcoded to 15 secs. No plans right now to make that an option. You can always edit the source - Core.pm. :) ) 3) What are the plans for fire.cloudmark, apt.cloudmark, ubik.cloudmark? It seems that we have all these catalogue servers yet a good portion of the time, only one is available or the last discovery ends up only listing one (currently honor.cloudmark) in the cataloge.lst file. The system is designed so servers can be added and subtracted without the clients caring - if the razor client can't connect to a server, it re-discovers, getting all currently available servers and stores results locally. ) 4) What would be the implications/requirements/caveats of hosting a catalogue server or, at the minimum, a caching server (similar to the way mail-abuse.org, for example, does dns zone transfers of its rbl list -- I realize that this is a completely different mechanism, but you get the point I am driving at here). I realize that there is an issue of polluting the catalogue but perhpas there could be some way of certifying a catalogue server? What type of bandwidth considerations are we looking at here? (It is just the signatures that are actually transferred across the pipes, is it not?) We are looking into releasing caching catalogue servers for those besides us to use. ) It really looks like there is a great potential here for a very workable tool and if I can get some of these issues addressed or can even be of some assistance, all the better ..... ) ) Sven Willenberger ) Systems Administration ) Delmarva Online, Inc.

By implication, then, you would say that ""most poor > people are stupid"". This is true, statistically, because most > people are poor and most people are also stupid. I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most other people. And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter don't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population. Hell, I grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly wasn't because of The Man. And my parents were poor because they made lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience. And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools. It isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being wealthy. > Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and > respected, but he's not particularly rich.

You are using a very narrow definition of ""smart"". Smart doesn't make you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich.

Still, a compelling point worth > some clarification. It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of what wealthy people are like. but with a higher net worth. In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy). ""Old wealth"" is incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually long-lived exceptions. It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort into it. However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and expend a lot less energy. Virtually all the people I know who are wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and exaggerated amounts of drive. Most people would not consider those people's lives ""fun"", though those people tend to enjoy what they do. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com",no

The people who were saying that it did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the .ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.

The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the initial SOA problems.

Whatever selection process IEDR used should be investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss of synch should not happen with a national domain.

We simply can't continue down the path where every script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can cause millions or billions of dollars worth of damage. (2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the point that digital signatures are the standard way to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging your machine or otherwise compromising your private key will be the only way that someone can forge a message from you. I don't see any reason that email software that automatically uses digital signatures for contact management and whitelisting would be any more expensive than existing email clients. Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly on it. (3) I think identity theft should be made a felony, with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply parading around with a sign that says ""I'm George Bush"" is not identity theft. On the other hand, I think using a virus to compromise someone else's private key should should fall into that category. MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your",no

"IWT Bans RIAA From Accessing Its Network August 19, 2002 Information Wave Technologies has announced it will actively deny the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) from accessing the contents of its network. Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new plan to access computers without owner's consent for the sake of protecting its assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its customers at risk of unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say the least. Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel the RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after the browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access and/or tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, Information Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA's web site. Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the RIAA to thwart this policy and apply additional filters to protect our customers' data. Information Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella network from its security research and development network (honeynet) which will offer files with popular song titles derived from the Billboard Top 100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will take place, these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the length of a 3 to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients which connect to our peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt to illegally access the network will be immediately blacklisted from Information Wave's network. The data collected will be actively maintained and distributed from our network operations site. The placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA's piracy elimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety of our customers' data attached to our network from hackers or corporate espionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.

"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com): > I'm confused. I thought it was GPL'ed and that the money you paid SuSE > was for your 60 day support or whatever? Yes, you're confused. A Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots of separate codebases. Some are under the GNU GPL. Many are not. Are you clear on this point, now? This is my second try. One suspects that you actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it. You're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to get covered software for free. It does not. It provides that _if_ you've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have rights to also receive the matching source code. > I don't particularly need support, so I'm not really interested in > purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use. Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way you can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not ""lend"" or duplicate) you his copy. > Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so > I'll just ask him. Ask him _what_? If you're asking him to ""lend"" or duplicate his CDs, then you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally. Don't like SuSE's product licensing? Write your own distribution. You can even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_. All you have to do is heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces. What, you think that's too much work? Then, try a different distribution. 7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among others. (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other hand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether open source or not.) -- Hi! I'm a .signature virus!

You seem to be saying that whitelists are useless, because there are worms which can compromise your system, read your address book/whitelist, and sent themselves on, compromising a nonnegligible fraction of systems as they go along. While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don't think this is true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken default settings, and insists to make documents executables.

"The die offs in areas with better records parallel and support the claims that European diseases were devastating to all American hemisphere populations, and the reverse was never true.

It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I'm a little more suspicious of very high upward revisions. At least that was my take.

Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new plan to access computers without owner's consent for the sake of protecting its assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its customers at risk of unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say the least. Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel the RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after the browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access and/or tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, Information Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA's web site. Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the RIAA to thwart this policy and apply additional filters to protect our customers' data. Information Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella network from its security research and development network (honeynet) which will offer files with popular song titles derived from the Billboard Top 100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will take place, these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the length of a 3 to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients which connect to our peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt to illegally access the network will be immediately blacklisted from Information Wave's network. The data collected will be actively maintained and distributed from our network operations site. The placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA's piracy elimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety of our customers' data attached to our network from hackers or corporate espionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.
